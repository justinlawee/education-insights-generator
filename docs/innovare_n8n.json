The x-axis will represent column_x, and the y-axis will represent column_y. This chart type effectively highlights the differences in values between categories. Additionally, a table displaying column_x, column_y, and any other relevant columns (e.g., column_z) will provide detailed information for each category.\"\n\nOption 2: Line Chart for Time Series Analysis\n\"For visualizing trends over time, a line chart is the best option. The x-axis will use the date_column, and the y-axis will use the metric_column. This chart will clearly show patterns, seasonality, and fluctuations in the data over time. A table with date_column, metric_column, and any other relevant metrics will provide precise values for each time point.\"\n\nOption 3: Table for Detailed Data Display\n\"When precise values are crucial, a table is the primary visualization method. Display column_1, column_2, and column_3 in the table, allowing for sorting and filtering to explore the data in detail. Additionally, a bar chart comparing column_1 (x-axis) and column_2 (y-axis) can provide a visual overview of the relationship between these two variables.",

This was designed to assist\nteachers in building background knowledge of the problem solving process that occurs\nthrough MTSS in order to be a knowledgeable participant of the MTSS team. Classroom\nteachers are integral in this process as they are the primary providers of instruction and\nintervention. Positive learning outcomes for all students within the MTSS framework are the\nresponsibility of all school personnel as a team facilitates the problem-solving process. The\nteam members may include students, parents, general educators, special educators,\ninstructional coaches, administrators, ESE personnel (school psychologists, speech-language\npathologists, occupational therapists), counselors, etc.\nState of Florida, Department of Education, Division of Public Schools and Community\nEducation, Bureau of Exceptional Education and Student Services has also created the\nfollowing resources focusing on the topic of MTSS:\n Florida Response to Intervention - http://www.florida-rti.org/\n Florida Introductory Online Training Course –\nhttp://www.florida-rti.org/introCourse/\n Problem Solving and Response to Intervention Project -\nhttp://floridarti.usf.edu/index.html\nIntroduction\n2\nChapter 1: Understanding the MTSS\nProcess\nWhat is MTSS?\nThe Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) process is a three-tiered approach to providing\nquality instruction to meet the individual needs of all students. This model combines a\nstandard system of assessment with high-quality instruction. Varying levels of interventions\nand services are designed for those students who are struggling. These levels are called tiers\nof instruction. The three tiers are on a continuum that is fluid, as the student’s level of need\ndictates the level of support. This movement relies on careful decision making that occurs\nthrough deliberate data collection and thoughtful analysis facilitated by a school team\nincluding the classroom teacher. Additionally, MTSS may also help schools identify students\nwho are eligible for an exceptional student education program. However, it is important to\nnote that the goal of the MTSS framework is to expand and implement instructional\nalternatives, settings, and support systems before exceptional education services are\nconsidered.\nThe state of Florida adopts the definition of MTSS as the practice of (1) providing high-\nquality instruction/intervention matched to student needs and (2) using learning rate over\ntime and level of performance to (3) make important educational decisions to guide\ninstruction (National Association of State Directors of Special Education, 2005). The MTSS\nmodel is a multi-tiered approach to providing high quality instruction and intervention matched to\nstudent needs, using learning rate over time and level of performance to inform instructional\ndecisions. MTSS involves the systematic use of assessment data to most efficiently allocate resources\nin order to improve learning for all students.\n The essential components of MTSS include:\n Multiple tiers of evidence-based instruction service delivery.\n A problem-solving method designed to inform the development of interventions.\n An integrated data collection/assessment system to inform decisions at each tier of\nservice delivery (Florida Problem Solving & Response to Intervention, 2008).\nThe Common Ground\nThe basic elements of MTSS are required by the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act and the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA); therefore, they are included in the broad-based\ninitiatives for schools striving to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) such as Reading First,\nFlorida’s Continuous Improvement Model, Florida’s Positive Behavior Supports, Problem Solving/\nMTSS State Pilot Project, and the Early Learning Success Initiative. Significant state initiatives have\nemerged since the enactment of the NCLB legislation.\nThe Problem\nAlthough these initiatives share common core elements and goals for all Florida schools, they are\nChapter 1\n3\neach facilitated by different offices within the Department of Education that address specific content\nareas or stakeholder groups. Each set of efforts is built upon common elements, but with single-\npurpose resources and in segregated activities. Each separate effort also involves a unique set of\nterminology, professional development requirements, and data collection and reporting systems,\nwhich result in district and school personnel perceiving that an overwhelming number of parallel\ninitiatives are either required or encouraged.\nThe Solution\nIt is the recommendation of stakeholders that the Florida Department of Education unify its efforts\nand resources to maximize efficacy and elevate the common beliefs through mutual understanding of\nthe principal foundation of MTSS and integration of that foundation throughout all statewide efforts\nand apply the principles of MTSS to a Multi-Tiered System of Supports for the students of Florida.\nHow MTSS Practices Integrate Into The MTSS Framework\nSome of the key points in understanding how MTSS practices integrate into the MTSS framework\nare:\n The MTSS framework is an educational systems change paradigm (Sansosti & Noltemeyer, Annual\n2008; Shores & Chester, 2009) that provides a framework for supporting students and staff as part\nof school improvement.\n MTSS begins in general education by establishing a strong core for all students that provides the\nfoundation of prevention within the entire system.\n MTSS includes PreK‐12 literacy, mathematics, and behavior as a continuum of instruction.\n The MTSS framework is inclusive to school accreditation and school improvement as well as\nschool‐wide behavior programs (FL Positive Behavior Supports) and provides a common\nframework for schools to integrate efforts.\n Universal screening assessments used within MTSS must measure the fluency and accuracy of\ncritical early skills that are predictive of future student skill attainment.\n Tiers within the triangle describe the intensity of instruction; not specific programs, students or staff\n(i.e., Title I, special education, etc.).\n The tiers describe instruction not steps in a process; therefore, students do not leave Tier 1 to\nreceive instruction in Tier 2 or 3 nor must a student receive Tier 2 instruction prior to receiving\nTier 3. The intensity of instruction (or tier of instruction required) is determined by the data.\n Students remain fluid within the tiered instruction meaning intensity of instruction students receive\nshould be transitioned up or down within the tiers based on student performance over a set\namount of time compared to predetermined decision points.\n The MTSS framework is a hybrid model using both protocol interventions and problem solving.\n Tier 3 is not special education nor does student success/failure at Tier 3 determine eligibility for\nspecial education. In no way should MTSS delay the initial evaluation of a student that is\nsuspected of having exceptionality.\n~Adapted from the Kansas MTSS\nWhat are the goals for MTSS?\n“The intent of MTSS is to ensure that students receive rich (learning) experiences every year\nin every setting with every teacher, not merely in some years in some settings with some\nteachers” (Howard, 2009). With this said, the goal of MTSS is not to only look at the learner\nbut also analyze and manipulate the learning environment, the curriculum being taught, and\nthe instruction being delivered. The state of Florida identified goals of MTSS:\n4\n Modify instruction and implement scientifically-based interventions based on individual\nneeds. The ultimate goal is student success in the form of increased academic\nachievement and positive behavior as early as possible.\n Ensure that students’ difficulties are not due to lack of appropriate instruction.\n Identify student needs early.\n Make informed decisions about what resources are needed to ensure student success by\nclosely monitoring student progress based on up-to-date data.\nWhat Does MTSS Look Like?\nWithin the MTSS model, there are three levels of instruction and intervention called tiers.\nThese three tiers use increasingly more intense instruction and interventions. Data is\ncollected at each tier and is used to make instructional decisions to determine if students are\nresponding to instruction and interventions. A problem-solving process is utilized to decide\nwhether the instruction and interventions should be maintained and layered.\nTier 1 instruction is the general education program. This means that ALL students are\nreceiving core instruction with flexible grouping and differentiation. Screening and progress\nmonitoring are utilized to determine instructional needs and measure student progress. The\ngeneral education teacher leads the Tier I instruction and support. Ongoing professional\ndevelopment is provided to teachers to enable them with the necessary tools to ensure all\nstudents receive quality instruction.\nFor students who are not making appropriate progress, teachers combine their core\ninstruction with additional interventions depending on the needs of the individual students.\nThis additional, supplemental support is called Tier 2 intervention. This level of service\nconsists of targeted, supplemental interventions aligned with the core curriculum. Tier 2\nsupports can be provided by the classroom teacher or school support faculty, such as reading\nor mathematics interventionists. These interventions are delivered in a small group format\nusing strategies known to be effective in addressing these learners (Problem Solving &\nResponse to Intervention, 2009). Progress monitoring data is used to adjust instruction and\nintervention.\nThere are a small percentage of students who still may show learning difficulties with Tier 2\nintervention. These students may need more support and intensity. Tier 3 interventions are\ndesigned for students who do not respond to Tier 1 and 2 interventions. This is the highest\nlevel of support and is more individualized. Tier 3 intervention is provided by a highly\nqualified teacher (reading or mathematics specialist) outside of the classroom. They should\nbe considered an “expert” within the area of the intervention. “Tier 3 instruction has to be\npotent and effective” (Hall 2008). The instruction is intensified and the duration and\nfrequency increases. Students who receive Tier 3 services are seen one-on-one and/or in a\nsmall group of 2-3 students and aligned with their Tier 1 instruction (core instructional\nprogram).\nTo determine whether instruction and interventions have been successful, teachers along with\nthe team engage in a problem-solving process. It is important to know if students are\n5\nresponding to high quality instruction and interventions. At each tier of MTSS, the Problem-\nSolving Approach is used.\nThe Problem-Solving Approach focuses equal attention on the learner, the environment, and\nthe curriculum. It is used to make decisions within each tier. The approach however is not a\nlinear process. The movement throughout the steps is dependent on the student. The steps to\nthis approach are as follows:\n1. Define - Determine what the problem is.\n2. Analyze - Analyze the problem using multiple sources of data to determine why this\nis happening.\n3. Implement - Establish an achievable goal and develop a plan that should be\nimplemented with a high degree of fidelity.\n4. Evaluate - Evaluate the success of the intervention based on student data. There\nshould be an increase in student performance and rate of progress, if not, what needs\nto be changed to better support the student?\nAcross the tiers, the problem-solving method is used to match instructional resources to educational\nneed. The problem-solving method is as follows:\n1. Define the problem by determining the discrepancy between what is expected and what is\noccurring. Ask, “What’s the problem?”\n2. Analyze the problem using data to determine why the discrepancy is occurring. Ask, “Why is it\ntaking place?”\n3. Establish a student performance goal, develop an intervention plan to address the goal, and\ndelineate how the student’s progress will be monitored and implementation integrity will be\nensured. Ask, “What are we going to do about it?”\nUse progress monitoring data to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention plan based on the\nstudent’s response to the intervention. Ask, “Is it working?” If not, how will the intervention plan be\nadjusted to better support the student’s progress?\n6\nFigure 1.1 portrays the continuous nature of the Problem-Solving Approach as it is utilized\nthroughout the tiers in the MTSS process. Problem solving never really ends because\nlearning is a cyclical process.\nFigure 1.1\nIn summary, Tier 1 instruction also known as core curriculum/instruction is designed for all\nstudents. “Tier 1 instruction should meet the needs of 70-80% (or more) of learners (Vaughn,\nWanzek, Woodruff, & Linan-Thompson, 2007). Tier 1 instruction includes differentiation\nand flexible grouping. The lowest 20 – 30 % may need additional support with Tier 2\nintervention, and it is anticipated that 5 – 10% will require Tier 3 instruction for intensive\nintervention” (Vaughn, Wanzek, Woodruff, & Linan-Thompson, 2007).\n7\nActivity 1: MTSS Rationale\nHow do you see MTSS and Problem Solving impacting your teaching and your\nstudents’ learning?\nTake a moment and reflect on your professional reactions to MTSS and Problem Solving.\nHow do you see this framework and process impacting your practice, students, classroom,\nand school? What are the benefits? Do you foresee any barriers? If so, what solutions do you\npropose?\nUse this space to record your professional reflections.\n8\nChapter 4\nChapter 2: Define – Problem Identification\nMeeting the learning needs of all students in a class can be a daunting task, especially given\ndiverse learning needs. The bottom line for each teacher, however, must be, “Are all of my\nstudents learning and making adequate and appropriate progress?” In order for a teacher to\naccurately answer this question, it is critical to continuously observe, think about, and\nanalyze students’ learning relative to his or her teaching and the standards and expectations\nof that curriculum and grade.\nThink of teaching as a science. Before scientists conduct a study, they must first identify a\nproblem to address, a question to be answered, or a phenomenon to be explained. Teachers\nbegin defining a problem in the classroom that is an area of concern related to classroom\ndata, (i.e., a need that is reflected in a level of student learning that does not meet the\nteacher’s, school’s, district’s, and/or state’s expectations). To adequately identify a classroom\nproblem, a teacher must take the time to investigate the initial areas of concern by collecting\nand analyzing information specifically aligned to the students’ learning needs. “Teachers\nwho rush to complete the problem formulation stage are more likely to flounder in their later\nefforts, whereas teachers who take their time to reflect on and define their problem are more\nlikely to pursue questions yielding meaningful results” (Sagor, 1992).\nWithin the MTSS model, teachers can identify problems at the whole class level (tier 1),\nsmall group level (tier 2), and individual student level (tier 3). To begin identifying a\nproblem, the teacher should utilize three pieces of key data: benchmark level of performance,\nstudent level of performance, and peer level of performance (Problem Solving and Response\nto Intervention, 2009).\n To define a problem, teachers identify the expected level of performance. What are\nthe appropriate benchmarks or expectations within a certain discipline (reading and/or\nmathematics) and grade level? Where should students perform during a certain point\nin the calendar year? This is important information to identify as without it, how do\nwe know a problem exists.\n Teachers will need to obtain and review student level of performance and compare it\nto the desired expectations. How are the students performing related to the expected\nlevel of performance?\n Teachers will also review peer level of performance. How are all the students\nperforming? Is there a discrepancy in the data? Are some students performing below\ntheir peers?\nWhen identifying a problem, teachers will want to look at the whole picture. They should\nconsider how their whole class is performing related to the benchmarks. This information can\nassist the teacher in determining if there is a universal problem (large group problem) that\nChapter 2\n9\nneeds to be addressed using Tier 1 interventions and/or a small group/individual problem that\nwill require Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions.\n1. What is the expected level of performance? When responding to this statement,\nthink about the assessments that are administered at your grade level and determine\nwhere your students should be performing at the specific time of the school year.\nExplicitly describe the benchmark level of performance that you will be reviewing\nwhen considering student and peer performance data.\n2. What is the current level of student(s) performance? When responding to this\nstatement, you can review the data as a whole group, small group, and/or individual\nstudent depending on your focus. You may want to look at your whole class to\ndetermine how the large group is responding to the core curriculum. It is important to\nconsider where your class should be performing and then identify the students who\nare not meeting the benchmarks.\n3. What is the current level of peer performance? Peer performance data is also\nutilized to determine how the whole class is responding to core instruction.\nAdditionally, it can be used to compare how some students are performing in relation\nto the whole class. This data may provide a global view of the severity of the\nproblem.\n4. What are the instructional goals for the student(s) (replacement behaviors)?\nOnce reviewing the data, create instructional expectations for the student(s) that are\nobservable and measureable.\nIt is important to note that defining a problem will more than likely occur with the assistance\nof MTSS team members. All members bring their strengths and knowledge to the team and it\nis vital that all are involved.\n10\nAnalyze- Problem Analysis\nOnce a problem is defined, it is important to continue asking and answering questions to\ndetermine why the problem is occurring. This step is very important in the process as it can\nprovide pertinent information on why a student is not responding to instruction and/or\nintervention. The teacher(s) will observe, question, and reflect on the actual current situation\n(of the entire classroom, group of students, or individual student) in order to investigate the\nidentified problem. Through this investigation, teachers and the team will need to gather\nadditional specific data to discover the occurrence of the problem. Only then will the team\nhave the right information to appropriately plan and design an intervention for the student(s).\nIt is recommended to collaborate with a knowledgeable team throughout this process as\ndifferent resources may be needed to evaluate the underlying causes.\n“The purpose of assessment in program analysis is for designing an educational intervention.\nThe focus should be on collecting information that will lead us to decisions about: what to\nteach (curriculum) and how to teach (instruction)” (Problem Solving & Response to\nIntervention, 2009). Focusing on this goal, data collection needs to be deliberate and well\nplanned out. It is important to delve deep, but remain focused. It is not about the quantity of\ndata, but quality. Do not administer assessments that are irrelevant to the problem being\nstudied. If certain questions on student learning have already been answered, there is no need\nto administer further assessments that will provide the same information.\nWhen the problem is being analyzed, the teacher and team find facts that are relevant. They\nwill use known information that has already been collected. Additionally, they will gather\nunknown information that relates to the learning problem being studied. A common question\nthat arises during this step is, “How do we determine what data is important to collect?”\nBefore thinking about the assessment tools or specific data sources, it is important to pose\nquestions. Teachers begin thinking about what information is needed to further investigate.\n1. In order to investigate the (classroom, small group, or individual student)\nproblem, we need to collection information:\nThink about what information you want to gather based on the learning needs of\nthe student and/or students. Why is this problem occurring? Why is there an issue\nthat needs to be changed? In order to attempt to answer these questions,\ndetermine what kind of information you need to know. Does the team already\nhave this information? If not, detail the information that needs to be collected.\nFor information that needs to be collected, think about how this is going to be collected.\nWhat assessment or data source will provide the appropriate information that the team needs\nto know?\nChapter 3\n11\n2. We will gather this information by collecting the following data:\nOnce you have considered what information you want to collect, decide how you\nare going to gather the information. What specific data sources or tools will you\nuse to collect the information to analyze the identified problem? Classrooms and\nschools are rich with data. Below you will find a quick reference chart of some\ndata collection sources.\nData Collection Sources\nStudent Work Samples\nFormal & Informal\nObservations\nSpecific Skill Assessment\nInterviews/Surveys\n(Student or parent)\nGrades, Report Cards,\nCumulative Records\nChecklists\nProgress Monitoring\nPerformance Assessments\nAnecdotal Data\nOnce all of the known and unknown information has been collected and reviewed, the team\nthen generates possible causes of the problem (hypotheses) that are based on facts from the\ndata collected (it is not a guess). The team can look at different assessment areas or domains,\nsuch as instruction, curriculum, environment, and the learner. This is a cyclical process as the\nteam may need to gather further information to determine whether a certain hypothesis is\nacceptable or not.\nAfter the teacher and team have identified the needed information to identify possible causes\nof the problem they should then narrow these possible causes to “one that is most likely\ntrue”. Analyzing a problem adequately will help lead to an appropriate intervention plan with\nthe goal of accelerating learning. At this stage of the problem-solving process, the teacher\nand team should be able identify why a problem is occurring and what could help assist the\nstudent in order to accelerate their learning.\n12\nImplement- Intervention Design\nThe third phase of the problem-solving process is to design and implement an intervention.\nOnce the problem has been identified and analyzed, the teacher and team decide how to\nintervene. An intervention is designed and/or selected that directly links to the student(s)\nproblem. At this stage of the process, the team is looking for a right match between the\nlearner and the intervention. The students should receive explicit evidence-based instruction\nfocusing on targeted skills within a supported learning environment.\nIt is important when developing an intervention for a student and/or students, that the\nplanning is directly linked to the problem solving that occurred in the last two phases of the\nproblem-solving process. This planning should be directly linked to the data that was\ncollected when identifying and analyzing the problem.\nWhen designing interventions for students, teachers and the team should follow specific\ncriteria for choosing appropriate interventions. The criteria include the following:\n The intervention and instruction should be evidence-based (programs, strategies,\ntechniques, etc.);\n The intervention and instruction should be delivered with integrity and fidelity;\n The intervention should allow for intensified instruction;\n The intervention should be implemented for a sufficient time;\n The intervention should be evaluated frequently; and\n The intervention should be integrated across the tiers.\nWhen planning for intervention, it is important to consider the “what” and “how”. What is\nbeing taught and adjusted? How is the intervention being taught and adjusted? The “what”\nand “how” are flexible and should be adjusted according to how the students are responding\nto the instruction and intervention. The content of the intervention focuses on the goal for\nimprovement. How the intervention is being taught relates to the frequency, duration, and\ngroup size. These factors play a significant role in the success or failure of instruction and\nintervention. As the learning needs become more severe, these factors may become more\nintensified. For example, the frequency of the intervention may occur five times a week\ninstead of three times.\n Deborah Simmons (2003) details alterable components that can be adjusted based on the\nstudent’s level of need. Refer to Figure 4.1. Notice how intensity increases from a level 1\n(low) to a level five within each of the five components: time and response opportunities,\ncore program efficacy, program implementation, group size, and coordination of program\nChapter 4\n13\nand instruction. Each one of these components can be adjusted or intensified if the desired\nresults are not achieved.\nAlterable Components & Specific Adjustments To Intensify Intervention (Figure 4.1)\nThe framework for the intervention is built by developing an intervention plan. Before\nimplementing the intervention, it is helpful to outline actions by answering the “what?” the\n“how” and the “when?” This plan is a blueprint or framework for change. Before creating the\nplan, take time to consider different instructional programs, approaches and conditions\ngeared towards meeting students’ instructional goals. Also, specifically identify the\nindividuals who will be responsible for implementing the plan. The intervention plan\nincludes the following topics:\n Persons responsible: Specifically name teachers who will be implementing the\nintervention, supporting and assessing the integrity of the intervention (coach), and\nmonitoring the effectiveness of the intervention.\n Skills and instructional strategies targeted: Identify specific skills that will be targeted\nin the intervention. What teaching strategies and techniques will be used to teach the\nskills?\n Implementation arrangements: These arrangements are similar to an implementation\nschedule. Where and when will the intervention be taught? How many times a week?\nHow long will the intervention sessions last? What materials will be utilized?\n Measurement Strategy: The purpose of the measurement strategy is to assess whether\nthe intervention is working or not. It is important to identify assessments that will\nprovide the right information on determining the effectiveness of the intervention.\n14\nDetail the person who will be monitoring student progress, the method of data\ncollection, and the schedule of progress monitoring.\n Decision Making Rule: Detail how to decide if the intervention plan is effective. The\nteam will consider the students’ progress in acquiring the newly learned skills as well\nas the rate of progress. In MTSS, there are also decision rules to consider. Is the data\nshowing a positive, questionable, or poor response to the intervention?\nWhen designing Tier I instruction/intervention, the teacher may consider adjusting the\ncurriculum and/or instruction for all of the students and/or some of the students. Whole group\nor small group instruction may be altered depending on the need. The time allocated does not\nchange; the curriculum and/or the instruction changes. Remember, the classroom teacher is\nthe sole provider of Tier 1 instruction and intervention.\nTier 2 intervention is in addition to Tier 1 support. This may occur in the general education\nsetting. The team will determine the amount of extra time that is needed, what curriculum\nwill be taught, and who/where will it be provided.\nIt is important to remember the I in MTSS. In order to evaluate whether an intervention is\nworking successfully, the teacher and/or interventionist must ensure the following:\n MTSS is based on the actuality of interventions delivered as intended;\n MTSS cannot be assessed if the intervention was not implemented as designed;\n Intervention integrity must be ensured and documented; and\n Integrity and documentation will become part and parcel of procedural safeguards.\nAdditionally, when designing, planning, and implementing the interventions, the teachers\nand/or interventionists should also consider the characteristics of effective instruction\n(Foorman et al., 2003; Foorman & Torgesen, 2001; Arrasmith, 2003; & Rosenshine, 1986).\nFigure 4.2 details characteristics of effective instruction. Guiding questions are listed to assist\nthe teacher in analyzing whether the characteristics are present within the\ninstruction/intervention. This tool can be used as a form of self-evaluation.\nFigure 4.2\nCharacteristic\nGuiding Questions\nFoorman et al., 2003; Foorman & Torgesen, 2001; Arrasmith, 2003;\n& Rosenshine, 1986\nGoals and Objectives\nAre the purpose and outcomes of instruction clearly evident in the\nlesson plans?\nDoes the student understand the purpose for learning the skills and\nstrategies taught?\nSystematic\nAre skills introduced in a specific and logical order, easier to more\ncomplex?\nDo the lesson activities support the sequence of instruction?\nIs there frequent and cumulative review?\n15\nExplicit\nAre directions clear, straightforward, unequivocal without vagueness,\nneed for implication, or ambiguity?\nScaffolding\nIs there explicit use of prompts, cues, examples and\nencouragements to support the student?\nAre skills broken down into manageable steps when necessary?\nCorrective Feedback\nDoes the teacher provide students with corrective instruction offered\nduring instruction and practice as necessary?\nModeling\nAre the skills and strategies included in instruction clearly\ndemonstrated for the student?\nGuided Practice\nDo students have sufficient opportunities to practice new skills and\nstrategies with teacher present to provide support?\nPacing\nIs the teacher familiar enough with the lesson to present it in an\nengaging manner?\nDoes the pace allow for frequent student response?\nDoes the pace maximize instructional time, leaving no down-time?\nInstructional Routine\nAre the instructional formats consistent from lesson to lesson?\n16\nEvaluate – Response to\nInstruction/Intervention\nAfter planning, intervening, and monitoring progress, it is very important to follow through\nby analyzing the results and making instructional decisions based on the findings. Analyzed\ndata will guide this critical question, “Was the intervention effective? There are many\ndecisions to make based on the data. The team will reflect on their decisions rules listed on\nthe intervention plan to decide next steps. Do we continue with the intervention? Do we re-\nanalyze the problem? Do we make further instructional adjustments?\nPositive Response\nThe data is showing that the students are responding to instruction and intervention. They are\nmaking progress towards their learning expectations. Based on the findings of the data, the\nteam will make decisions on next steps:\n1. Continue with the intervention as designed focusing on the current goal\n2. Continue with the intervention as designed, but increase the learning expectations.\n3. Fade the intervention and monitor student\nQuestionable Response\nThe students’ response to the intervention is questionable. The student is either making some\nprogress, but at a very slow rate which is not allowing for the gap to close, or the student’s\ngap is widening, but not a fast rate. It is important to analyze whether the intervention was\nimplemented as intended. If there are gaps, short-cuts, or absences in implementation then\nthe plan should be revisited and implemented as designed. Instructional coaching may be\nneeded to determine how to get the implementation back on track.\nIf the intervention was implemented as intended, then the team may decide to increase the\nintensity of instruction and monitor student progress closely.\nPoor Response\nThe students are not responding to the intervention and the gap is increasing. Again, the first\nthing to review is implementation of the intervention. Was it delivered with integrity and\nfidelity? Was the timeline followed (frequency, duration)? The instructional coach is a great\nresource at the school site to assist with integrity and fidelity concerns. If the poor responses\nare due to implementation concerns, then the plan needs to be revisited to determine how to\nget on track. It may be a simple solution such as communicating with the grade level team in\nprotecting intervention time.\nIf the intervention was implemented as intended, the team has three choices to make:\nChapter 5\n17\n Determine whether the intervention was aligned with the intervention design. Did the\nintervention teach the skills that were noted as the instructional focus on the\nintervention design?\n Re-analyze the problem. Look for another underlying cause. Collect more data if\nnecessary to determine other learning needs.\n Re-define the problem. Review the steps in the problem identification stage to\ndetermine if the problem can be re-identified.\n18\nConnecting MTSS and Professional\nDevelopment\nProfessional Development Needs\nAs the MTSS framework becomes integrated in all of our schools, many professional\ndevelopment needs will continue to rise. Not only will teachers need to understand the\nframework itself, but more in-depth professional learning will occur to meet the learning\nneeds of all students in the areas of curriculum and instruction.\nThe Florida Professional Development System Evaluation Protocol is currently being revised\nin order for the standards to be infused within the Response to Intervention Model. The\nteacher’s Individual Professional Development Plan will be driven by classroom-level\ndisaggregated student achievement data. Professional learning goals will be developed and\nevaluated based on the learning needs and progress of the students. Professional learning\ncontent will be directly aligned to student data. Implementation of instruction and\nintervention will be observed by highly-skilled instructional coaches to ensure high-fidelity\nof professional learning. Furthermore, professional development will follow a team approach\nthrough learning communities.\nThe professional development standards and components of the MTSS model are linked to\nensure that the learning needs of both students and educators are aligned.\nChapter 6\n19\nProblem-Solving Plan\nSchool:\nClassroom Teacher’s\nName:\nGrade Level/Subject Area:\nDefining a Problem\n What is the expected level of performance?\nWhat is the current level of student(s) performance?

She struggles with counting and cardinality (numbers 0-100). Her teacher works with her in and a small group of students for 10 mins./2x a week using math manipulatives and explicit math guidance for counting 1-1. Margo then works on IXL math independently for the other 3 days a week for 10 mins. during math centers. The teacher logs her explicit and implicit math intervention in the BrM platform and uses the IXL data as her progress monitoring tool.\nINTERVENTION\nLET’S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW INTERVENTIONS LOOK IN THE SCHOOL SETTING AND ARE DOCUMENTED\nIker is a sophomore high school student taking English II. He is struggling with developing cohesive argumentative writing pieces. His English teacher identifies the platform Think CERCA as an appropriate intervention tool for Iker to practice organizing and thinking through his writing process. An interventionist works with Iker on the platform during Study Hall for 15 mins./3x per week, over an 8 week period. His progress is monitored using his in-class writing pieces and the teacher created rubrics and logged in the BrM platform.\nLaiba is a fifth grade student who has done very well academically in school. However, this year she has been struggling with the core content areas. The team noticed that Laiba is missing school on average 3-5x per month. After speaking to her parents, they now know that due to work schedules Laiba is now walking to school by herself. The team decides that Check in-Check out (CICO) intervention with the school counselor would benefit Laiba each session is logged into the BrM platform. Attendance data is used for progress monitoring.\nEli is a third grade student struggling to decode multisyllabic words. The teacher has already taught syllable division strategies to the whole class. However, Eli needs additional guided practice. The teacher decides that Eli, along with a small group of students, would benefit from the Word Sorts strategy. She works with them for 10 min./2x per week, over 5 weeks in guided sessions and documents this intervention but does not apply a progress monitoring tool.\nSTRATEGY/\nSUPPORT\nLET’S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW SUPPORTS/ STRATEGIES LOOK IN THE SCHOOL SETTING AND ARE DOCUMENTED\nSofie is a first grade student who enjoys school. When she knows an answer she is eager to share it and shouts over her peers. The school counselor has shared a PBIS reward system with the classroom teacher to utilize. At the end of each day, Sofie and her teacher discuss if she has earned a sticker for the day for raising her hand and waiting to be called on. At the end of the week, if Sofie has earned 3+ stickers she can pick an item from the counselors treasure chest. This strategy is logged in Branching Minds.\nMohammad is a ninth grade student. He struggles with processing math word problems. His math teacher has shared the strategy Concrete-Representational- Abstract (CRA) with him and a small group of students that he meets with for 10 mins./3x per week. The teacher guides the students as they practice utilizing this strategy with a variety of additional word problems. Their progress is informally monitored biweekly over 6 weeks and logged into the BrM platform.\nIsaiah is a senior high school student who failed Biology his first semester. He is normally a conscientious student, but was juggling school, work, and homelife during this time. Nearing high school graduation, his school counselor has identified the need for credit recovery and indicated this service in the BrM platform.\nSERVICES\nLET’S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW SERVICES LOOK IN THE SCHOOL SETTING AND ARE DOCUMENTED\nZion is a fourth grade math student. He does very well in math, but is struggling with the new math topic (fraction conversions) and it atypically shy compared to their peers. The teacher identifies a few outgoing students who would also benefit from some additional practice. She invites this small group of students to a math lunch bunch. They eat, socialize, and work on converting fractions at lunch time through December. The teacher logs this service into the BrM platform but does not collect intervention/progress data.\nAbigail is a sixth grade student struggling with comprehension skills. During the school day she receives individualized reading intervention support from her teacher. However, there is a reading focused after-school tutoring club that she would also benefit from. With parent permission, she is enrolled in the club and attends 1 hour/daily for one quarter. This extra service is tagged and the tutor logs intervention and biweekly progress monitoring data in the BrM platform.\n### Document: MTSS Intervention Logging Tool Presentation.pptx ###\n Starting the 2016-17 School Year MTSS Ready!\nAugust 2016\nOffice of Teaching & Learning\nLaTanya D.

State-level\npriorities include consensus building, infrastructure development, and implementation.\nFlorida MTSS merges Florida PS/RtI, Florida Positive Behavior Supports (PBS), and\nTechnology and Learning Connections for Assistive Technology and Universal Design for\nLearning to support district-wide implementation of an integrated data-based planning\nand problem-solving system.\nFlorida Administrative Code 6A-6.6.0.331 General Education Intervention\nProcedures, Evaluation, Determination of Eligibility, reevaluation and the Provision\nof Exceptional Student Education Services says, “…it is the local school district’s\nresponsibility to develop and implement a Multi-Tiered System of Supports which\nintegrates a continuum of academic and behavioral interventions for students who need\nadditional support to succeed in the general education environment.”\nThis implementation guide is intended to serve as a guide to support schools in their\nimplementation of MTSS.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 2 | 60\nPART 1: Implementation Guidelines\nMTSS – Multi-Tiered System of Supports\nThe Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) model aligns resources in schools for\nproviding high quality instruction and intervention matched to student needs. Learning\nrate over time and level of performance are used to inform instructional decisions. The\nMTSS model addresses both academic and behavior needs of students through instruction\nand interventions developed to meet those needs. The problem solving/response to\nintervention (PS/RtI) component of MTSS is required in Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004). Problem\nsolving and measuring the response to intervention through progress monitoring ensures\nthe quality and validity of classroom instruction.\nIn effective Multi-Tiered System of Supports:\n•\nLearning is accelerated to close gaps and prevent new ones.\n•\nFewer students are at risk over time.\n•\nDecisions about who needs additional support can be made rapidly.\n•\nRates of intervention success are high.\n•\nGoals are defined in terms of improved achievement.\nElements of an effective Multi-Tiered System of Supports Implementation include:\n1. Leadership\n2. Building Capacity/Infrastructure for Implementation\n3. Communication and Collaboration\n4. Data-Based Problem Solving\n5. Three-Tiered Instructional/Intervention Model\n6.

order to manage and fulfill the\nabove responsibilities and tasks. For effectiveness and efficiency in the team meeting, some\nof the SBLT members are assigned the following roles:\nFacilitator\nGenerates agenda and leads team discussions and data-based\ndialogue\nData Manager/Coach\nAssists team in obtaining and interpreting of data\nTechnology Specialist\nObtains and understands technology necessary to manage and\ndisplay data\nRecorder\nDocuments meeting content and disseminates to team members\nTime Keeper\nHelps team begin on time and ensures adherence to agreed-upon\nagenda\nClear expectations for these roles should be developed by the SBLT early in the year.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 6 | 60\nSBLT Meeting Schedule\nSBLTs will develop a meeting schedule based on their particular needs. It is strongly\nsuggested that the SBLT meet weekly on a specified day and time. Regularly scheduled\nmeetings signal importance, encouraging attendance and participation. An example of an\nSBLT schedule and functioning:\nThe SBLT meets Tuesdays from 7:45 a.m. to 8:45 a.m.\n*Content leadership and Child Study activities may be scheduled into agenda at every meeting. Agenda items\nrequired to be submitted 1 day in advance of meeting.\n1st and 3rd Tuesdays\n7:45 – 8:00\nTier 2 Student Engagement data reviewed and analyzed (behavior,\nattendance, retentions, etc.\n8:00 – 8:45\nAction Planning for student engagement is developed or revised based on\ndata analysis\n2nd and 4th Tuesdays:\n7:45 – 8:15\nTier 2 documentation and progress monitoring data reviewed and analyzed\n(reading, math, science, writing) – Grade level team leader facilitating (K-2 on\nthe 2nd Tuesday, 3- 5 on the 4th Tuesday)\n8:15 – 8:45\nAction Planning for content core is developed or revised based on data\nanalysis\n**If parent participation is required for discussion of a specific student, a team will be assigned to meet with the\nparent separate from the SBLT meeting.\nData chats must be scheduled by the SBLT a minimum of 3 times a year following the\nschedule of benchmark assessments. Separate data meetings should occur for Tier 1, Tier2,\nand Tier 3 problem solving.\nFor example:\n•\nTier 1: The SBLT will schedule a data day for reading 3 times a year following each\nCommon Assessment window.\n•\nTier 2: The SBLT will meet with the K-3 grade teams every 8 weeks, and the 4-5\ngrade level teams every 10 weeks during PLC to discuss ongoing progress\nmonitoring data and evaluate intervention effectiveness.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 7 | 60\n•\nTier 3: The Tier 3 Problem Solving Team will schedule meetings as a result of SBLT\nTier 2 data meeting outcomes, and to review and revise individual problem-solving\nplans.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 8 | 60\nMTSS Infrastructure\nBuilding the capacity to implement MTSS is crucial to being able to sustain the use of\ncollaborative inquiry/data-based decision making. Key factors in capacity-building include\ninvolving key people and leaders; building the school culture to support the practice;\nworking to infuse collaborative inquiry into ongoing structures such as faculty meetings,\ncurriculum committees, and PLCs; and making use of student data to inform actions an\nexpectation for all staff.\nThe SBLT facilitates professional development (PD) and coaching for all staff members\n(relative to their job roles and responsibilities) on:\n•\nassessments and data sources used to inform decisions\n•\ndata literacy and data-based problem-solving\n•\nmulti-tiered instruction and intervention\nThe School-Based MTSS Coach\n(Facilitator or Instructional Staff Developer)\nCoaching must be used to support MTSS implementation. The school-based MTSS coach\nshould be expected to:\n•\nfacilitate or model the components of MTSS\n•\nprovide opportunities to practice problem-solving skills\n•\nprovide collaborative and performance feedback to all staff\n•\ndevelop coaching activities based on PD feedback, implementation fidelity, and\nstudent outcomes.\n (See Appendix for MTSS Coach’s Roles and Responsibilities)\nThe role of the school-based MTSS Coach, who may also be identified as a facilitator, staff\ndeveloper, or team leader, is to provide technical assistance and support to school staff to\nimprove implementation of the components of a Multi-Tiered System of Supports model.\nResponsibilities may include:\n•\nModel and support data literacy:\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 9 | 60\no gain basic knowledge of school data and assessments\no interpret and guide analysis of multiple data sources effectively to improve\nteaching and learning\no encourage all other school staff to achieve data literacy\n•\nFacilitate collaborative problem solving processes:\no convene leadership/data teams\no plan team meetings\no facilitate the process of data-driven dialogue\no guide the problem-solving team through collaborative inquiry\no promote equity and effective Learning for all students\no create an environment where each team member safely and fully participates\n•\nProvide leadership for sustainability of systems:\no institutionalize collaborative inquiry:\n▪\nbuild a foundation on shared values, standards, vision\n▪\nidentify student learning problems\n▪\nverify causes (root cause-and-effect analysis and validation)\n▪\ngenerate solutions,\n▪\nimplement, monitor, and achieve results\n•\nDemonstrate leadership in instructional improvement\no ensure intervention for closing achievement gaps\no build consensus for Multi-Tiered System of Supports and\ncollaborative problem solving\no influence school culture by building a vision\no\ncelebrate successes\no support and contribute to the development of comprehensive data systems\nthat provide timely and accurate information.\no Commit to ensuring equity and learning for all students.\n•\nProvide assistance and professional growth opportunities to teachers:\no train and mentor in the use of materials, assessment strategies, best practices\no monitor and provide high-quality feedback on the fidelity of interventions\nprovided to improve student achievement.\nScheduling to provide adequate time for trainings and coaching support is essential. The\nSBLT is responsible for ensuring that time is available for administering and collecting\nassessments needed to make data-based decisions, providing multiple tiers of evidence-\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 10 | 60\nbased instruction and intervention, and for staff to engage in collaborative, data-based\nproblem-solving and decision making.\nProcedures and Resources\nSystematic processes, procedures, and decision-rules needed to engage in data-based\nproblem solving must be developed and incorporated school-wide. Procedures should be\nrefined based on data and feedback from the staff, schedule changes, and resource\navailability.\nResources including personnel, funding, and materials should be documented in resource\nmaps and other documentation of resource allocation. Those maps should be updated at\nleast annually based on student need, available personnel, funding, materials, and other\nresources.\nThe School-Based Leadership Team is responsible for developing a strategic plan for the\nimplementation of MTSS in its own school setting, and for documenting that plan in the\nSchool Improvement Plan. The plan for infrastructure should include ongoing professional\ndevelopment and coaching with an emphasis on data-based problem-solving and multi-\ntiered instruction and intervention, and processes and procedures for engaging in data-\nbased problem-solving.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 11 | 60\nCommunication and Collaboration\nOn-going communication and collaboration are essential for successful implementation of\nMTSS. Many innovations fail due to a lack of consensus, to a lack of feedback to\nimplementers to support continuous improvement, and to not involving stakeholders in\nplanning. In addition to including stakeholders, it is also important to build the\ninfrastructure to communicate and work with families and other community partners.\nThere practices increase the likelihood that innovative practices will be implemented and\nsustained.\nSelf-Assessment of MTSS Implementation (SAM National Pilot Version 2.0\n(November 2014)\nStakeholder support and consensus are essential to the implementation in MTSS. The\nsuccess or failure of any change initiative rests on the commitment and support of key\nmembers of the school community. Activities that will build that commitment and\nconsensus include:\n•\nBuilding a vision of the compelling, desired future for the school that is\ncommunicated clearly and often\n•\nStrongly supporting the work of the SBLT and of data use\n•\nCreating a safe environment for data use; not using data to harm, but to support\n•\nEmpowering teachers to make instructional decisions based on data\n•\nHelping staff members access resources; e.g., research or curriculum materials\n•\nModeling the practice of using data\n•\nProviding teachers with timely access to data and time to meet to practice\ncollaborative problem solving and inquiry\n•\nFostering a culture of family and community engagement\n•\nActively engaging families in MTSS; i.e.,\no Actively engaging families that represent the diverse population of the school\no Engaging families in problem solving when their children need additional\nsupports\no Providing intensive (individualized) outreach to unresponsive families. That\nsupport should be an individualized approach requiring information\ngathering and problem solving to identify outreach strategies that are more\nlikely to be successful for a family that is not engaging with the school’s typical\noutreach. (SAM National Pilot)\nData-Based Problem Solving\nProblem solving is the practice of providing high-quality instruction/intervention matched\nto student needs and using learning rate over time and level of performance to make\nimportant educational decisions. (Batsche, et al., 2005). Data-based problem solving means\nthat data are used effectively to improve Learning, and informs how patterns of student\nperformance across diverse groups (e.g., racial/ethnic, cultural, socio-economic, language\nproficiency, disability status) are addressed.\nIntegrated data-based problem solving for student academic, behavior, and social-\nemotional outcomes occurs across content areas, grade levels, and tiers. Across all tiers,\ndata are used to identify the difference or “gap” between expected outcomes and current\nstudent performance relative to academic, behavior, and social-emotional goals.\nIn the Data Coach’s Guide to Improving Learning for All Students, Nancy Love and her co-\nauthors suggest that the following assumptions are foundational for an effective data-\nbased problem solving team:\n➢Making significant progress in improving student learning and closing achievement\ngaps is a moral responsibility and a real possibility in a relatively short amount of\ntime – two to five years. It is not children’s poverty or race or ethnic background that\nstands in the way of achievement; it is school practices and policies and the beliefs\nthat underlie them that pose the biggest obstacles.\n➢The meaning of data is imposed through interpretation. Effective data users become\naware of and critically examine their frames of reference (how we see the world) and\nassumptions. Data themselves can also be catalysts for questioning assumptions and\nchanging practices based on new ways of thinking.\n➢Collaborative inquiry (constructing understanding of student-learning problems and\ninventing and testing out solutions together through rigorous and frequent use of\ndata and reflective dialogue) unleashes the resourcefulness and creativity to\ncontinuously improve instruction and student learning.\n➢A school culture characterized by collective responsibility for student learning,\ncommitment to equity, and trust is the foundation for collaborative inquiry.\n➢Improved teaching comes about when teachers implement sound teaching practices\ngrounded in cultural proficiency and a thorough understanding of the subject matter\nand how to teach it.\nRevised 8/1/17 M T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e P a g e 12 | 60\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 13 | 60\nAt all levels and in all settings, the problem-solving process incorporates at least the\nfollowing four steps in a cyclical, recurring model to address prevention, early\nintervention, and intensive intervention:\nStep 1: Problem Identification\nWhat is the problem?

Problem Identification/Identifying the Student Learning Problem What\nis the problem?\nThe MTSS problem solving team will analyze data from as many sources as possible, and\nfrom as many levels as possible (aggregated, disaggregated, strand, item, and student work)\nto identify the discrepancy between what is expected and what is occurring. The goal is to\nglean as much information about student learning from the data source as possible. Data\nsources might include:\n•\nState assessments to identify trends over time in the percentage of students meeting\nor exceeding the standards (school, district, state)\n•\nDisaggregated state assessments to identify trends in learning over time for\nstudents in specific populations achieving proficiency at a specified grade level and\nwithin a specified content area\n•\nStrand-level analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses in student learning in\nrelation to specific content and learning outcomes\n•\nOther common assessments and local student-learning data sources to refine\nunderstanding of student-learning needs\n•\nFor individual student learning problems, the team may examine student\nperformance on individual items and skills (academic and behavior), and student\nwork to further clarify and define the problem.\nThe problem-solving team will use all data sources to articulate a clear learning problem\nand an accompanying learning goal.\nFor the Problem-Solving Worksheet, the team will state what the student(s) should be able\nto do in observable and measurable terms; i.e., identify the target skill.\n•\nThen, collect data regarding the current level of performance, the expected\nlevel(s) of performance, and the peer group performance. The team will need to\nbe able to review the data by grade, classroom and subgroup.\n•\nOnce this data is obtained, a gap analysis can be conducted –difference between\nstudents’ current and expected level of performance. This allows the team to\ndetermine at what level the intervention needs to be focused and the intensity of the\ncurrent problem.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 17 | 60\nAn example of Gap Analysis:\nFrom the Data Coach’s Guide to Improving Learning for All Students, p. 152\nJohn Carr has developed a guide for describing meaningful differences that is “a mixture of\nstatistical significance, effect size, and practical significance derived from many years of examining\ntest results in large districts.” Note that the table is meant to be a rough gauge rather than a precise\nmeasure of meaningful differences.\nMeaningful Differences Guide\nTotal Number of students being compared\nDescriptive\ndifference\n50\n100\n200\n500+\nPercentage point difference\nNone\n0-12\n0-8\n0-5\n0-3\nSmall\n13-15\n9-11\n6-7\n4-5\nModerate\n16-19\n12-14\n8-10\n6-8\nFairly Large\n20-25\n15-17\n11-13\n9-10\nLarge\n26-29\n18-24\n14-19\n11-15\nVery large\n30+\n25+\n20+\n16+\nSource: Carr.J., & Artman, E.M.

This step involves generating hypotheses and gathering information\nto confirm or refute hypotheses generated. The problem analysis step is crucial and yet\nfrequently overlooked. Time spent analyzing a problem through gathering known and\nunknown information will help teams make sound, defensible decisions leading to\nimplementation of a well-designed intervention that will have a greater likelihood for\nsuccess.\nThe flowchart presented in Figure 1 serves as a guide for the steps in Problem Analysis.\n1. The first step in problem analysis is to determine whether the team has sufficient\ninformation to begin generating hypotheses. In most instances the team will have\nenough data to begin this process and should move to step 2.\nHowever, if this is not the case, then more information is gathered. Information is\ngathered through the use of Reviews, Interviews, Observations, and Tests (RIOT).\nFurther information about the use of these RIOT procedures is provided below.\n2. Once the team has enough information, hypotheses are generated about why\nthe target skill is not occurring. Hypotheses should be:\na. Based on research relevant to target skills,\nb. Focused on alterable variables,\nc. Lead to intervention, and\nd. Consider both skill and performance deficits.\nHypotheses should also be generated in the domains of Instruction, Curriculum,\nEnvironment, and the Learner (ICEL). This is done across all tiers. Further\ninformation about these four assessment domains is provided below.\n3.\nOnce hypotheses are generated, the team utilizes available information to\nvalidate or rule out the hypotheses. The validation of a hypothesis is crucial\nbecause if the hypothesis is inaccurate and the wrong intervention is implemented,\nvaluable time could be wasted on an intervention that was not an appropriate\ninstructional match for the student.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 19 | 60\nAssessment Domains - ICEL\nTraditionally, assessment of problems focused on student’s intrinsic characteristics. The\ndata-based problem solving process provides the opportunity to examine the interaction\nbetween the instruction, curriculum, learning environment and learner(s) in order to\nidentify a discrepancy and subsequently identify an intervention to close the gap. When\ngenerating hypotheses for why the replacement behavior is not occurring, information from\nthe following domains should be considered:\nInstruction (how curriculum is taught)\n▪instructional decision-making regarding selection and use of materials and\nplacement of students in materials\n▪frequency of interaction/reinforcement\n▪clarity of instructions\n▪communication of expectations and criteria for success (behavioral and\nacademic)\n▪direct instruction with explanations and prompts (behavioral and academic)\n▪sequencing of lesson designs to promote success\n▪variety of practice activities (behavioral and academic)\nCurriculum (what is taught)\n▪long range direction for instruction\n▪instructional materials\n▪intent\n▪arrangement of the content/instruction\n▪pace of the steps leading to the outcomes\n▪stated outcomes for the course of study\n▪general learner criteria as identified in the school improvement plan and state\nbenchmarks (behavioral and academic)\nEnvironment (where instruction takes place)\n• physical arrangement of the room\n• furniture/equipment\n• clear classroom expectations\n• management plans\n• peer interaction, expectations, reinforcement, support\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 20 | 60\n• schedule\n• task pressure\nLearner (who is being taught)\n▪skills\n▪health\n▪prior knowledge\n▪tracking (lower-track students get more drill and practice)\n▪cultural background\n▪poverty\n▪trauma\nThe Learner domain is the last to consider and should not be addressed until the instruction\nand curriculum are appropriate and the environment is positive. If discrepancies in these\nareas are not resolved first, interventions in the Learner domain alone are not likely to\nsucceed.\nAssessment Procedures - RIOT\nAssessments in the problem-solving process are conducted to answer assessment\nquestions to gather relevant information about the problem and validate or rule out a\nhypothesis. Assessment questions should always be answered by utilizing Reviews,\nInterviews, Observations, and Tests.\nThe order of the RIOT assessments holds significance in that they are listed in order of\nleast intrusive and time intensive to the most intrusive and time intensive. Answers to\nquestions should be sought using information available through review and interview\nprocedures before turning to the more intrusive and time intensive observations and\ntests. Teams should seek convergent data as important educational decisions should not\nrest on one source of data.

Within this intervention plan, goals are set and a plan for how to evaluate\neffectiveness is determined. The purpose of an intervention is to create an instructional\n(academic and/or behavioral) match based upon the verified hypotheses from the problem\nanalysis step.\nInterventions address either a skill deficit (i.e., lack of skills to successfully complete task)\nor a performance deficit (i.e., factors interfering with capability of performing the skill).\nInterventions should be designed to adjust what is being taught and/or how it is taught and\nshould be integrated across tiers. Additionally, the level of support (Tier level) should be\nincreased until an intervention is identified that results in a positive response to\nintervention.\nThe intervention plan should address the person(s) responsible, skills targeted, and\nimplementation arrangements (e.g., frequency, duration, location). Similarly, the\nmonitoring plan for determining student progress must include the person(s) responsible,\nwhat data will be collected and how often, and how it will be determined if the plan is\neffective.\nIntervention fidelity cannot be overemphasized in this step. The fourth step of problem\nsolving (evaluate) is based on the veracity of interventions in Tiers 1, 2 and 3 delivered as\nintended; therefore, response to intervention cannot be evaluated if the intervention was\nnot implemented or implemented poorly. In order to increase fidelity, an intervention\nsupport plan is included for each intervention. This refers to the ongoing support provided\nto the implementer of the interventions, e.g., training on the intervention and/or progress\nmonitoring measure, ongoing consultation to ensure other barriers do not develop, etc. This\nsupport plan should include the person(s) responsible, what will be done, when it will\noccur, and where it will occur. A support plan is included within the Intervention Plan\nsection of the Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Problem Solving Worksheets.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 24 | 60\nStep 4: Response to Intervention/Achieving Results\nIs it working?\nThe fourth step in the problem- s o l v i n g process is to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe intervention plan based on data collected. To make data-based decisions about the\neffectiveness of the intervention, the ongoing progress monitoring data must be displayed\ngraphically.\nDecisions about Data: The graphic display of data provides a clear illustration of\nexpectations and performance over time that is easily interpreted by parents and educators.\nThis visual comparison to a standard enables a team to know if learning gains are being\nmade, and if so, under what conditions.

All students are\nlikely to benefit from improved Tier 1 strategies (e.g., highly effective\nteaching, strong and structured behavioral expectations), even those who\nare already proficient in the targeted skills. Far fewer students will need\nsupplemental interventions if effective Tier 1 strategies are implemented.\nIf Tier 1 strategies are not implemented with fidelity or are\nineffective despite being implemented with fidelity, the goal of the\nSchool Based Leadership Team should be to identify necessary\nchanges to Tier 1 curriculum, instruction, and supports.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 32 | 60\nTier 2: Supplemental Support for Some Students\nSupplemental intervention is provided to any\nstudent in need of additional supports or\nintervention for a targeted skill to continue to\nprogress within the core instruction.\nTier 2 is:\n➢Additional supplemental instruction/intervention that some students need to be\nsuccessful with core grade level expectations.\n➢Supplemental (or strategic, or targeted) because these interventions address\nspecific student problems.\n➢Delivered in addition to core Tier 1 instruction.\n➢Linked to core curriculum and expectations.\n➢Problem-solved with decisions make in collaboration with the School-Based\nLeadership Team (SBLT).\n➢Progress monitored at least bi-weekly, and results are graphed.\n➢Evaluated for effectiveness by the SBLT.\n➢Documented in the records of the SBLT.\nTier 2 Assessment Examples:\nTier 2 Supplemental Intervention\nExamples:\n•\nCommon Assessments\n•\nSchool Assessments such as ODRs,\ntardies, absences, suspensions\n•\nObservations\n•\nData from differentiated instruction\n•\nGap analysis\n•\nAdditional minutes or smaller group\nfor reading skills\n•\nGo Math Strategic Intervention\n•\nAnger management small group\n•\nCheck In/Check Out\nThe purpose of Tier 2 Supplemental instruction and supports is to improve student\nperformance to proficiency in the Core curriculum. Tier 2 services are “effective” when at\nleast 70% of students receiving those services in addition to Core supports meet or exceed\ngrade level proficiency.

That\ndocumentation should include clear evidence that SBLT members have developed data\nliteracy to a level that allows thinking about the variety of types and levels of data, how to\nuse that data, and how to use it effectively.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 36 | 60\nTier 2 (Supplemental/Strategic) Problem Solving\nTier 2 problem solving is the responsibility of the School Based Leadership Team. Students\nwho require supplemental supports will be identified because of Tier 1 problem solving\nthat includes determining that core instruction is effective (approximately 80% or more\nstudents are meeting grade level expectations), but that some students require additional\nsupport to achieve grade-level standards.\nThe purpose of Tier 2 problem solving is to answer the following questions:\n▪\nWhat is the appropriate intervention for a given group of students?\n▪\nHow effective are the interventions selected for students identified as needing\nTier 2 supports?\n▪\nAre most students within a given supplemental group demonstrating a positive\nresponse to the instruction?\n▪\nAre there students who may require increased intensity/individual problem\nsolving to accelerate their growth rate?\nPossible sources of Tier 2 data include gaps between students’ performance and expected\nlevels of performance in program assessments and district common assessments, and\nprogress monitoring data collected regularly to measure the progress of students receiving\nsupplemental intervention.\nTier 2 (Supplemental) problem solving is engaged in by the School-Based Leadership Team\nand its designated sub-committees. The work of the team should be documented in an\nAction Plan for Collaborative Problem Solving.

Tier 3 problem solving is the\nresponsibility of the Tier 3 Problem Solving team, comprised of at least two members of the\nSBLT (one of whom is highly trained in problem solving), the child’s teacher, and the child’s\nparent or guardian.\nThe purpose of Tier 3 problem solving is to answer the following questions:\n•\nWhy is the desired behavior not occurring? What are the conditions under which it\ncan or cannot occur?\n•\nWhat about the interaction of the curriculum (including assessments), instructional\npractices, learning environment (including equity issues), and the Learner may be\nhindering the desired outcome?\n•\nWhat data do we have to validate or rule out possible barriers/causes? What is the\nmost likely explanation?\n•\nGiven the outcome of problem analysis, what additional supports need to be\nimplemented to accelerate the student’s rate of growth?\n•\nWhat is the student’s response to this intensive intervention? How well are the\nselected individualized, intensive supports helping the student reach the goal or\ndesired behavior?\n•\nWhat is the relationship between sustained growth and sustained support? When\ndoes, the data indicate that supports can be faded or minimized in intensity?\nThe data-based decision that a student may require individualized, highly-intensive\nsupports should be made by the Tier 3 Problem Solving team because of evaluating a groups’\nresponse to Tier 2 intervention. Problem solving at this level is focused on the individual\nstudent who has not made similar progress in the identified skill area as other students\nreceiving the same small group intervention and core instruction. Interventions at Tier 3 are\ndiagnostic and precise, and are delivered individually or in a very small 2:1 or 3:1\npupil/teacher ratio) group setting with progress monitoring occurring more frequently\n(weekly for academic skills and daily for behavior).\nIt is the Tier 3 Problem Solving team’s decision to increase the intensity of intervention\nto a Tier 3 level for some students should be reflected in the results section of the Tier 2\nProblem Solving Worksheet. The student’s Tier 2 data is summarized on the Student Tier 2\nData Summary. (see Appendix - add to eLearn forms list PCS Tier 2 Problem Solving\nWorksheet from eLearn).\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 38 | 60\nDocumentation of problem solving in the Tier 3 Problem Solving Team should be\nmaintained both for compliance purposes and to facilitate the transfer of a plan to another\nschool should the student transfer.\nSupport Responsibilities for Tier 3 Problem Solving\nThe SBLT must designate/assign a school-based staff member to support the work of the\nTier 3 Problem Solving Team(s). That staff member is responsible for such functions as:\n•\nScheduling Tier 3 meetings in coordination with the Tier 3 Problem Solving Team\nFacilitator, including regular review and revision meetings as planned in the\nProblem-Solving Worksheet or Functional Behavior Assessment.\n•\nInviting the parent, and notifying other team members, when the meeting is\nscheduled and where it will be held.\n•\nMaintaining a confidential list of students who have been identified by the SBLT as\nrequiring problem solving to develop intense interventions. The list should include\nthe dates of problem solving meetings, and the names of the problem-solving\nfacilitators and the child’s case manager if the child receives ESE services.\n•\nImplementing the system established by the SBLT to secure documentation and\ndata from problem solving and intervention implementation.\nShould it be determined that a student requires an evaluation to consider eligibility for\nExceptional Student Education (as a student with a disability or a student needing Gifted\nEducation services), the Tier 3 support person, in collaboration with Student Services\npersonnel, will manage the collection/gathering of the documentation necessary to\nconsider eligibility; e.g., consent forms, eligibility checklists, etc. It is not required that the\nsupport person attend all meetings.\nIf a teacher or parent has concerns about a student that have not been determined through\ndata reviews to need supplemental instruction /intervention, the concerns should be\nconsidered in the data discussions at Tier 1, PLC discussions, etc.\nTier 3 Problem Solving Team\nThe Tier 3 Problem Solving Team is comprised of at least 2 members of the SBLT (one of\nwhom is highly trained in problem solving), the teacher and the parent. It is suggested that\none member from the SBLT be the educational diagnostician and/or school psychologist if\nthe concern is academic skills or academic behaviors.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 39 | 60\nIf the concern is social behavior skills, a Pinellas County Schools-trained FBA facilitator\n(school psychologist, school social worker, or behavior specialist) must be one of the SBLT\nmembers assigned to the team. If the student is experiencing severe behavior and academic\nconcerns, the team must include the FBA facilitator and a member who can address the\nacademic problem solving as well. As needed, the team may include other staff as well.\nCritical to the MTSS framework and the three-tiered service delivery model is the degree to\nwhich the interventions in Tiers1, 2, and 3 are integrated. The purpose of Tier 2\nsupplemental intervention is to improve achievement of core, grade-level standards; the\npurpose of Tier 3 is to support progress in supplemental intervention and achievement of\ngrade-level standards in the core. If a student requires intensive (Tier 3) intervention, then\ninstruction/intervention in Tiers 1 and 2 should also be intensified.\nEnsuring that services provided across tiers are integrated and support a student's success\nin core instruction is essential. This can be accomplished by scheduling and building in\nteacher/ interventionist communication opportunities where teachers discuss the\nfollowing:\n• Scope and sequence of core instruction\n•\nScope and sequence of Tier 2, Tier 3 instruction\n•\nStudent progress\n•\nUpcoming lesson information to allow for pre-teaching opportunities\n•\nAligning instructional vocabulary across tiers to eliminate discrepancies\nThe Tier 3 Problem Solving Team will review the Tier 1 and Tier 2 data and determine what\nadditional information might be needed to answer the questions of Tier 3. The RIOT/ICEL\nsummary sheet and/or the Data Coaches Guide chart including equity and critical support\ncan be used to guide the collection of information. As much information as possible should\nbe gathered before the initial meeting so that problem solving can be as efficient as possible.\nFor students who continue to demonstrate severe social behavior difficulties after the\nimplementation with fidelity of Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports and interventions, Tier 3 will\ninclude a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) which will result in a Positive Behavior\nImprovement Plan (PBIP).\nFor some students who demonstrate severe difficulties in both academic and social\nbehavior skills, both a Tier 3 Problem Solving Worksheet (PSW) and an FBA/PBIP will be\ndeveloped. Similar data may need to be used in problem solving. It is strongly recommended\nthat the same team develop the academic and the behavior plan to ensure that the plans\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 40 | 60\nand the supports are aligned. Additionally, both academic and behavioral causes/barriers\nshould be considered for either target skill in problem analysis.\nThe parent will be invited to the Tier 3 Problem Solving meeting which will be held at a\nconvenient time for the parent and teacher. If there is no time that the parent can attend,\nalternate methods to ensure participation are expected, such as conference calls. All\nattempts to ensure parent participation should be documented.\nAn in-depth discussion of the problem-solving steps is found in the beginning section of this\nsection. These steps are the same at Tier 3 as for Tier 1 and 2. While the focus of problem\nsolving at Tier 3 is individualized, the hypothesis building involves the interaction of the\nInstruction, Curriculum, and Environment with the Learner.\nStep 1 – Problem Identification: What is the Problem?\nThe targeted concerns are identified through the data from the SBLT and from the\nRIOT/ICEL information. As in Tier 1 and Tier 2, the Tier 3 Problem Solving Team will use\ndata to quantify the problem. The team will have the current level of performance and the\nrate of learning for the student because of Tier 1 and Tier 2 problem solving.\nStep 2 – Problem Analysis: Why Is It Occurring?\nThe team will employ problem solving to consider the possible reasons the difference exists\nbetween the current level of performance and rate of learning and the expected or desired\nlevel of performance and rate of learning. The hypotheses and the data to validate or rule\nout the hypothesis are listed. The team will make a prediction that if a given intervention\nis implemented, the problem will be reduced.\nStep 3 – Implementation Plan: What Are We Going to Do About It?\nInterventions are planned that are aligned with the hypothesis and prediction and that\nincrease the intensity of what has been provided to the student up to this point. Intensity of\nintervention can be increased by modifying the following:\n1.\nFrequency of intervention – how often will group meet?\n2.\nDuration – for how many minutes will intervention take place?\n3.\nFocus – what will be taught?\n4.\nSize of group – how many students will be in the instructional/intervention\ngroup?\nThe intervention plan must include a support plan for the provider and/or teacher, a\nprogress monitoring plan, and a plan for monitoring the fidelity of the implementation.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 41 | 60\nStep 4: Response to Intervention: Is It Working?\nTo know if interventions are working for students identified as needing Tier 3 supports\nand to determine what changes, if any, need to be made, the following data must be\nidentified:\n•\nCurrent Level of Performance (trendline of ongoing progress monitoring data\npoints)\n•\nExpected Level of Performance\n•\nAimline (a line drawn from current level of performance at initiation of\nintervention to the established goal/desired level of performance)\nThis data will be graphed in a format (generally a line graph) that includes the trendline,\naimline, and benchmark or desired level of performance. The measure is plotted on the\nvertical axis and the time on the horizontal axis. The graph must clearly provide a visual of\nthe data that will enable the team to make decisions about the response to the intervention.\nThis information is used to determine next steps.\nProblem solving does not stop until the gap has closed (or will close in an acceptable\namount of time) and the supports can be withdrawn without decline in student\nperformance.\nWithin the group of students that require intense intervention (Tier 3), some students\nmay be identified as students with disabilities and require specially designed instruction\nto be successful. Problem solving continues for students who are determined eligible for\nESE services at the same level of intensity as for students requiring Tier 3 interventions\nwho do not have a disability. If a student is suspected of having a disability, an evaluation\nshould be requested. Information on processes and procedures to consider this possibility\ncan be found in the ESE Handbook.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 42 | 60\nData Evaluation\nThe School-Based Leadership Team is responsible for ensuring that all staff understand\nthe purposes of assessment and have access to academic, behavior, and social-emotional\ndata sources that address the following purposes of assessment:\n•\nidentify students at risk academically, socially, and/or emotionally\n•\ndetermine why a (any) student is at risk\n•\nmonitor student academic and social-emotional growth/progress\n•\ninform academic and social-emotional instructional/intervention planning\n•\ndetermine student attainment of academic, behavior, and social-emotional\noutcomes\nCritical guiding questions and assessment practices are refined and adjusted to ensure the\navailability of accurate and useful data to inform instruction.

Staff must also consistently administer\nassessments, access data sources and make data-based decisions with fidelity to the\npolicies and procedures established by the leadership team.\nThe SBLT should periodically conduct analyses to determine how implementation of\ncritical elements of MTSS relate to positive student outcomes; that is, resources are\nallocated based on student need, the relationship between the resources allocated and the\noutcomes of students is evaluated, and processes and criteria for resource allocation are\nrefined based on strategies that result in improved student outcomes.\nIt is also vital that the SBLT evaluate how MTSS is implemented, providing information on\nwhat practices relate to improvements in student academic, behavioral, and social-\nemotional outcomes. Key stakeholders may ask critical questions such as these:\n➢How much consensus is there among educators that MTSS should be implemented?\n➢Does the school and district staff possess the knowledge and skills to implement\nMTSS?\n➢To what extent are educators implementing evidence-based instruction and\ninterventions across grade-levels, content areas, and tiers with fidelity?\n➢What steps of problem-solving are being implemented with fidelity?\n➢How are students performing compared to grade-level expectations?\n➢What other factors may be contributing to MTSS implementation and student\noutcomes?\nResponding to questions like these allows key stakeholders to prioritize what data to\ncollect and to develop methods and procedures for gathering the information.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 44 | 60\nAPPENDIX\nGLOSSARY\nAdequate Yearly Progress - a statewide accountability system mandated by the No Child\nLeft Behind Act of 2001 which requires each state to ensure\nthat all schools and districts make adequate yearly progress\nas defined by states and as approved by the US Department\nof Education.\nAimline –\nline on a graph that represents expected student growth over\ntime\nBaseline Data -\ndata collected prior to an intervention; used in making a\ncomparison with data collected during and/or after the\nimplementation of an intervention\nConsensus -\nallowing all staff to learn about what changes are needed and\nto allow them to have a stake in the design of what PS/RtI\nlooks like at their school; beliefs are shared, vision agreed\nupon and implementation requirements are understood\nCore Curriculum -\nthe course of study deemed critical and usually made\nmandatory for all students of a school or school system.

MTSS offers an evidence-based framework for effectively coordinating and\nintegrating services throughout the school system to ensure that all students succeed. Maximizing and sustaining these efforts requires schools and\ndistricts to promote and implement a set of essential school practices (defined below). School psychologists have specific expertise, knowledge, and skills\nto help schools employ these essential school practices and leverage ESSA policy opportunities. These skills and the broad range of services available\nfrom school psychologists are defined within the NASP Model for Comprehensive and Integrated School Psychological Services, more typically referred to\nas the NASP Practice Model. School psychologists are uniquely trained to provide a comprehensive range of services that enable schools to implement\ncomprehensive systems of student supports, improve school and district effectiveness, and support improved outcomes for all students. Full realization\nof these efforts requires full funding of ESSA as Congress intended, effective blending of multiple funding streams, committed leadership, and consistent\nefforts to work toward the NASP recommended staffing ratio of 1 school psychologist for every 500–700 students.1\nThe table below outlines how ESSA connects with MTSS, essential school practices, and the broad role of school psychologists working within the scope\nof services described in the NASP Practice Model.

Schools collect a multitude of\ndata about student and school performance. Schools must have the capacity to collect, integrate, and interpret data that are relevant and capture the most\nimportant indicators of key outcomes. They also must be able to look at data in a coordinated fashion to identify connections that should influence\ndecision-making related to instruction, programming, and learning supports and services. Examples of necessary student data include screening for\nacademic and behavioral concerns, health data, engagement, performance on classroom assignments and standardized tests, and more. Examples of\nsystem and school-wide data include attendance and truancy data, discipline reports, school climate and safety indicators, teacher engagement and self-\nefficacy assessments, and student and family engagement information.\nComprehensive, rigorous curricula provided to ALL students. All students, including high-performing students , English language learners, students\nreceiving special education services, those struggling with barriers to learning, and those with disciplinary problems, should have access to a rigorous,\nhigh-quality balanced curriculum and high expectations for achievement. Students should receive instruction in subjects including reading, math, science,\nsocial studies, foreign language, physical education, and the creative arts. This instruction, and related assessments of progress, should be culturally and\nlinguistically responsive to students’ individual backgrounds and circumstances. Rigorous curricula must provide opportunities for students to\nmeaningfully engage with content; teach students how to access and evaluate the validity of information; build the capacity to conceive, develop, test, and\ncommunicate diverse ideas; and contribute to the ability to thrive in an increasingly competitive global economy. Schools should also make a sustained\ncommitment to teach and hold students accountable for critical life skills such as social–emotional competency, self-control, problem solving, and conflict\nresolution.\nEffective coordination of services across systems and within schools. Multitiered systems of support (MTSS) include a cohesive data collection process\nthat demonstrates student progress through the curriculum and toward goals regardless of whether they are receiving special or general education\ninstruction. Effective coordination requires regular opportunities for peer-to-peer consultation focused on problem solving, assessment, and intervention\namong teachers, principals, and other specialized instructional support personnel. Equally important is the development of mechanisms to increase\nfamily engagement and supportive relationships between students and caring adults within the school and the community.\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 57 | 60\nProvision of evidence-based comprehensive learning supports. Learning supports are the resources, strategies, and practices that provide the physical,\nsocial, emotional, and intellectual supports that directly address barriers to learning and teaching, and that re-engage disconnected students. Learning\nsupports within MTSS provide a framework to promote success and wellness and prevent problems, coupled with a continuum of evidence-based\ninterventions of increasing intensity for students in need of additional support.\nIntegration of comprehensive school mental and behavioral health services into learning supports. Mental and behavioral health services are\nessential components of comprehensive learning supports, as students’ mental and behavioral health underlies every aspect of learning. Access to school-\nbased mental health services is linked to improved students’ physical and psychological safety and reduces costly negative outcomes such as risky\nbehaviors, disciplinary incidents, delinquency, dropout, substance abuse, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Importantly, mental health\nissues can also impact school culture and climate, which can affect the learning and sense of well-being of the entire student population. Comprehensive\nmental and behavioral health services, like other comprehensive learning supports, must be linguistically and culturally sensitive and are most effective\nwhen embedded within an MTSS framework. MTSS enables schools to promote mental health and wellness and identify and address problems before\nthey escalate or become chronic and to provide increasingly intensive, data-driven services as needed.\nIntegration of school climate and safety efforts into school improvement efforts. Feeling safe and supported are necessary conditions for students to\nlearn and achieve. Schools enable teachers’ ability to teach and students’ ability to learn when we ensure that all students: (a) come to school feeling safe,\nwelcomed, and respected; (b) have a trusting relationship with at least one adult in the school; (c) understand clear academic and behavioral\nexpectations; and (d) see their role as positive members of the school community. Comprehensive school safety is supported when schools combine\nreasonable physical security measures (e.g., visitor check in procedures, locked doors) with efforts to enhance school climate, improve student\nengagement, foster respectful and trusting relationships among students and staff, and support overall student success. Similarly, school safety and crisis\nteams should be multidisciplinary and trained to address the continuum of prevention, planning, response, and recovery, with response and recovery\nbuilding on ongoing positive behavior, risk assessment, safety, and mental health services.\nProvision of hig- quality, relevant professional development. All school staff must have access to continuous, job embedded professional development\nthat improves their capacity to address the unique needs of the school community and its students. Professional development should include classroom-\nbased strategies for ongoing progress monitoring; practices for improved recognition of mental and behavioral risk; and teaching practices that promote\npositive and specific academic, social–emotional, and behavioral strategies for struggling students. Professional development should be targeted to the\nspecific needs of professionals within the school rather than one-size-fits-all training for staff at large.\nMaintaining a comprehensive accountability system. School accountability systems must use multiple indicators of student outcomes including\nacademic achievement, behavioral health indicators, progress toward life goals, perceptions of the school environment, college and/or career readiness\nskills, indicators of educator effectiveness, and factors that contribute to positive learning environments, including school connectedness and safety.\nEffective accountability systems help identify and offer the appropriate supports needed for schools struggling to meet student needs and allow a\nreasonable time to improve and appropriate response when schools fail to progress.\nFOUNDATIONAL RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 58 | 60\nNASP Model for Comprehensive and Integrated School Psychological Services. The NASP Practice Model represents NASP's official policy regarding\nthe delivery of school psychological services and is one of four major parts of NASP’s 2010 professional standards. In addition to the NASP Practice\nModel, the standards cover ethical principles, training, and certification. The NASP Practice Model is not a job description; rather, it identifies what\nservices can reasonably be expected from school psychologists. Specifically, the model delineates the 10 domains of practice in which school\npsychologists are trained and the organizational principles that need to be in place in school districts to support effective service delivery.\nMultitiered systems of support . MTSS describes a framework for providing comprehensive systems of differentiated supports. Data-driven decisions\nregarding instruction and intervention are provided in increasing intensity (i.e., tiers) based on student need. Tier 1, or universal supports, typically\nrefers to services available to all students (e.g., wellness/skills promotion and school-wide programs). Tier 2 services (targeted) are available to some\nstudents identified as needing some additional services or supports (e.g., small group counseling, tutoring, targeted behavioral skills training). Tier 3\nrefers to more intensive services for individuals or small groups and is usually limited to only 5–10% of students (e.g., individualized instruction,\nintensive therapy, wraparound services).\nAdequate and integrated funding sources. ESSA offers states and districts more flexibility to blend various funding streams (e.g., Title I, Title II, and\nTitle IV) to provide high-quality instruction, professional development, and comprehensive learning supports based on the unique needs of the school\ncommunity. This allows for a more holistic review of the needs of the school and where funds can be used most effectively.\nAdequate staffing ratios. NASP recommends a ratio of 1 school psychologist per every 500–700 students, along with appropriate and adequate\nprofessional supervision, in order to provide comprehensive school psychological services. School psychologists able to provide a broad range of services\nto all students and families to improve school climate and safety, remove individual barriers to learning, and ensure that students are engaged, attentive,\nand available for learning. However, due to inadequate staffing ratios, they often must limit their range of services to a small subset of students, leaving\nfewer opportunities for prevention and early intervention services.\nRELEVANT NASP RESOURCES\nNASP Model for Comprehensive and Integrated Psychological Services (NASP Practice Model)\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/standards-and-certification/nasp-practice-model\nNASP Practice Model’s 10 Domains of Practice\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/practice-model-domains\nNASP Practice Model Organizational Principles\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/practice-model-organizational-principles\nNASP Practice Model Implementation Guide\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/standards-and-certification/nasp-practice-model/nasp-practice-model-implementation-guide\nRevised 8/1/17\nM T S S I m p l e m e n t a t i o n G u i d e\nP a g e 59 | 60\nNASP 2010 Professional Standards\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/standards-and-certification\nReady to Learn, Empowered to Teach: Guiding Principles for Effective Schools and Successful Students\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/ready-to-learn-empowered-to-teach\nA Framework for Safe and Successful Schools\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources/school-safety-and-crisis/a-framework-for-safe-and-successful-schools\nSchool Psychologists: Qualified Health Professionals Providing Child and Adolescent Mental and Behavioral Health Services\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/white-papers/qualified-mental-health-professionals\nThe PREPARE School Safety and Crisis Prevention and Intervention Training Curriculum\nhttp://www.nasponline.org/professional-development/prepare-training-curriculum\nNASP Online Learning Center\nhttps://nasp.inreachce.com\nDownload the Crosswalk and related advocacy and communications planning resources www.nasponline.org/practice-model/ESSA-MTSS-\ncrosswalk\nPlease cite this document as:\nNational Association of School Psychologists.

Assist stakeholders in understanding a Multi-Tiered System of Supports\n2. Provide an in-depth look at the essential components of an effective MTSS Model\n3. Clarify the usefulness and value of MTSS in regard to student outcomes\n4. Explain best practices for the implementation of MTSS for ALL students.\nThe information in this guidance document is not intended to be a substitute for training; it is\nintended to increase understanding of the MTSS framework and the Three-Tiered Model. For\nadditional supports or training on MTSS and the Three-Tiered Model, please contact\nIntervention Services in The Office of Elementary Education and Reading or visit our Menu of\nServices.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n7\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of the MTSS Guidance Document is to aid in the effective implementation of a\nthree-tiered instructional model in order to support and increase academic, behavioral, and\nsocial emotional outcomes for ALL students. This guide addresses the complexity of multi-tiered\ndecision making and identifies critical decision points within Tier I (universal or core\ninstruction for all students), Tier II (supplemental instruction), and Tier III (intensive\nsupports).\nIn addition, this guidance document will provide best practice recommendations and\nrequirements within a MTSS framework that includes the effective selection and\nimplementation of decision making teams, gathering accurate and reliable data that can be used\nto make meaningful instructional changes for students, establishing and managing intensive\ntiers of support, and evaluations of the tiers to ensure the supports provided are effective.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n8\nSECTION 1\nThree Tier Instructional Model\nThe Mississippi State Board of Education’s Policy 41.1 requires that districts and schools follow a\nthree-tiered instructional model consisting of:\n•\nTier 1: high-quality classroom instruction,\n•\nTier 2: focused supplemental instruction, and\n•\nTier 3: specifically designed intensive interventions as prescribed.\nThis systematic approach supports struggling learners, as well as advanced learners, through the\nselection of evidence-based instruction and intervention in response to both academic and\nbehavioral needs. The system includes on-going progress monitoring of the effectiveness of\ninstruction to ensure that all Mississippi students graduate from high school ready for college\nand career. Such model enables early identification of students in need of supports and allows\nfor appropriate supports to be put in place as soon as a student starts to fall behind.\nThe policy, as approved by the Mississippi State Board of Education, may be viewed in its\nentirety in Appendix A of this document.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n9\nSECTION 2\nMississippi MTSS: Essential Components\nIn Mississippi, districts and schools are encouraged to utilize the cohesive framework,\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS), to align current resources and initiatives in order to\nmeet the academic and behavioral needs of ALL students, such as those with an IDEA or gifted\neligibility, English learners, juvenile justice involved youth, students with dyslexia, and students\nof poverty. MTSS is a method of organization of supports which ensures optimal educational\noutcomes for students, pre-K-12th grade. It aligns the entire system of supports, encompasses\nResponse to Intervention (RtI) and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), and\nensures effective team-based problem solving that is data informed and evidence-based.\nMississippi’s model for MTSS consists of six essential components:\n•\nShared Leadership\n•\nFamily, School, & Community Partnerships\n•\nData-Based Problem Solving and Decision Making\n•\nLayered Continuum of Supports (Tier I, Tier II, Tier III)\n•\nEvidence-Based Instruction, Intervention, & Assessment\n•\nUniversal Screening & Progress Monitoring\nThe essential components of a\nMTSS allow for a continuum of\nsupports, working together\nendlessly, to improve student\nacademic and behavioral\noutcomes by design, and\nredesign, of appropriate\nservices through promotion\nof equitable practices.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n10\nSECTION 3\nEssential Components Defined\nCOMPONENT 1\nSHARED LEADERSHIP\nOverview\nEffective leadership is key in impacting student success. Within MTSS, shared\nleadership allows for distribution of responsibilities and promotes shared decision\nmaking among a diverse group of individuals with a common vision and common\npurpose in an effort to achieve desired outcomes. For successful implementation of\nMTSS it is critical to establish leadership teams at both district and school levels.\nThe function of these teams is to ensure effective implementation throughout\ndistricts, schools, classrooms, and communities through a data-based problem\nsolving and decision making process. Leadership teams should hold regularly\nscheduled meetings to engage in on-going study and analysis of data in order to\nimprove instruction, intervention, and assessment. Other key leadership team\nresponsibilities include but are not limited to:\n•\nCreating an engaging and safe learning environment\n•\nImproving outcomes through collaboration and communication\n•\nAllocating and distributing available resources\n•\nCoordinating and providing professional development\n•\nSupporting fidelity and sustainability\nDistrict Shared\nLeadership

school year.\nSample Leadership Team\nSelf-Assessments from Colorado\nDepartment of Education:\n Building Leadership Team Self-\nAssessment\n MTSS Leadership Team Self-\nAssessment\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n14\nCOMPONENT 2\nDATA-BASED PROBLEM SOLVING AND\nDECISION MAKING\nOverview\nData-based problem solving and decision making is a critical component of MTSS as it\ndrives instruction and intervention. District and school staff should collaborate to\ncreate an integrated data collection system consisting of academic and behavioral data\nsuch as results of state assessments, universal screeners, diagnostic assessments,\nprogress monitoring, formative and summative assessments, attendance, office\ndiscipline referrals, and observations provided by school personnel as well as\nparents/guardians. Data should be collected and analyzed on ALL students, of all\nsubgroups, throughout the year.\nThe following four step problem-solving process allows teams to determine appropriate\ninterventions within a three-tiered instructional model to provide for the academic and\nbehavioral needs of all students. Each step of the process is necessary for ensuring that\nstudents are prescribed the right interventions at the right time, allowing for increased\nstudent outcomes.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n15\nFour Step Process\nThe four step data-based problem solving and decision making process:\nSTEP 01\nDEFINE THE PROBLEM OR GOAL\nAsk, “What specifically do we want the student(s) to know and be able to do?”\nIn the area of academics, the “What we expect students to know and do,” is\ndriven by the Mississippi College-and Career-Readiness Standards, which\nguide instruction at each grade and relevant subject area. In the area of\nbehavior, “What we expect students to know and do,” is guided by district and\nschool-wide expectations, age-appropriate student engagement behaviors,\nand the pro-social behaviors that support a positive school climate.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n16\nSTEP 02\nANALYZE THE PROBLEM\nThis analysis phase, often referred to as problem analysis, gap analysis, or\nroot cause analysis, is an essential phase. Effective analysis provides the\nfoundation for the rest of the data-based decision making process. The goal of\nthis analysis is to answer the questions:\n•\nWhy is the gap occurring?\n•\nWhy is the student not achieving the desired academic or behavioral\noutcomes?\n•\nWhat are the possible barriers to the student doing and/or knowing\nwhat is expected? During this analysis, the team uses data to generate\nhypotheses, or possible root causes, that are grounded in evidence.\nData are used to either confirm or disprove the hypotheses.\nSTEP 03\nDEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE PLAN\nOnce the problem/deficit area is confirmed, the team selects an intervention\nthat is best matched to the student’s needs. During this step of the process,\nthe team develops a plan to enable the individual student to reach the goal.\nDetails are essential as the team must outline the specifics of the plan.\nStrategies and instruction included in the plan should be clearly stated (what,\nwho, when, where, how long). The selected interventions must be evidence-\nbased and carried out with integrity.\nA GOOD PLAN:\n\nExplicitly states what will be taught (the focus of whole-\nclass instruction or student-specific intervention)\n\nFocuses on measurable objectives\n\nDefines specifically who is responsible for each action\nand a timeline\n\nDescribes a plan for measuring and monitoring the\neffects of the intervention; a quantifiable baseline and\ntarget goal is identified\n\nDescribes a plan for monitoring/ensuring fidelity to\nthe plan\n\nIdentifies resources available for implementing\nthe plan\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n17\nOnce the plan has been implemented, data collection (progress monitoring at\nagreed upon intervals) and fidelity checks begin. Progress monitoring data\nshould directly reflect the target deficit area. See Component 6 for more\ninformation on progress monitoring.\nSTEP 04\nEVALUATE THE PLAN\nHow has the student responded to our plan? This last step in the data-based\ndecision making process requires the team to use data gathered from\nprogress monitoring and other sources, as described above, to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the plan. Changes to the plan may occur as student outcomes\nare continually monitored.\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER\nRESOURCES\no Progress monitoring should align\nwith deficit area(s) as indicated\nby data.\no Selection and implementation of\nsupports should be based on\nmultiple pieces of data.\no MTSS is not a “wait to fail” model\nor a pre-referral process.\no Instruction/intervention plans\nshould be fluid and may be\nchanged based on\nsubsequent data reviews.\n Center on Response to\nIntervention at American\nInstitutes for Research: Data-\nBased Decision Making\n Johns Hopkins School of\nEducation: Problem Solving\n Colorado Department of\nEducation Data Based Problem\nSolving and Decision Making\n Four Step Problem Solving\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n18\nCOMPONENT 3\nLAYERED CONTINUUM OF SUPPORTS\n(TIER I, TIER II, TIER III)\nOverview\nAll students have access to a layered continuum of supports, regardless of achievement\nlevel. Effective instruction and meaningful interactions, such as positive student-\nteacher relationships are key elements across all the tiers. A layered continuum of\nsupports ensures that ALL students receive equitable academic, behavioral, and social\nemotional supports that are culturally and linguistically responsive, matched to need,\nand developmentally appropriate. Each layer of support increases with intensity from\nuniversal (ALL students) to targeted (some students) to the most intensive supports\n(few students).\nTier I is the UNIVERSAL layer of support for ALL students and consists of high-quality\nclassroom instruction provided by highly trained and qualified personnel. Tier I\ninstruction occurs in whole group, small group, and in individual settings. Tier I\nshould be considered the key component in successful tiered instruction.\nTier II is the TARGETED layer of support for SOME students that consists of\nsupplemental academic and behavioral supports provided in addition to core high-\nquality instruction.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n19\nTier III is the most INTENSIVE layer of support for FEW students and consists of the\nmost intensive, targeted instruction and intervention specifically designed to meet the\nindividual academic and behavioral needs of students.\nChild Find is the district’s responsibility to identify, locate, and evaluate all students\nsuspected of having a disability. Students may be identified for a suspected disability\nregardless of tier or placement within the continuum of supports.\nAdditional information on Tiers I-III and Child Find may be located in\nsections 5-7 of this guidance document.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n20\nCOMPONENT 4\nFAMILY, SCHOOL, AND COMMUNITY\nINVOLVEMENT\nOverview\nThe goal of family, school and community relations is to create partnership practices to\nsupport all students. Evidence indicates that students are more successful when families\nand schools are connected, and students feel that adults are invested in their learning.\nWhen students feel connected, motivation and attendance improve, directly affecting\nacademic and behavioral outcomes. With effective partnerships in place, families are\nempowered to ensure that students have access to learning opportunities that will\nsupport their success.\nFamilies, educators, and community members possess varied levels of education,\ncultures, languages, needs, and interests. District and school staff should consider the\ndiverse needs of families and the community as they create opportunities to establish\ntrusting relationships. The collaboration of families, schools, and communities as equal\npartners will increase student, classroom, school and district outcomes through the\npromotion of equity for all. These partnerships are critical for the successful\nimplementation of MTSS.\nCommunication between schools and families is imperative for student success.\nProviding information to families and community stakeholders is an effective way to\nfacilitate support, educational progress, and encourage active involvement. Schools\nshould have an open-door policy for families and community members and welcome all\nfeedback. Resources and services for families, students, and the school through\ncommunity groups, including businesses, agencies, cultural and civic organizations, and\ncolleges or universities should be available as part of the MTSS implementation.\nCommunication with all stakeholders can be disseminated through various channels,\nhowever, it should be considered that access to technology, and other resources, varies\namong families.\nParent Communication Tips\nTeachers, or other school personnel as designated, should consistently communicate\nwith parents of all students at all academic and behavioral tiers. It is essential to provide\nparents with methods to help their child at home and follow-up to see what additional\nsupports might be needed. Parents can serve as integral participants in TST meetings,\nproviding important student data, they should be kept abreast of scheduled meetings\nand when unable to attend, be provided with a meeting summary.\nBest practices suggest notifying parents when students are placed in interventions, but\nparents MUST be notified when students are placed in Tier III. Progress monitoring of\nintervention results should be sent home regularly and also shared with parents at\nTST meetings.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n21\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER\nRESOURCES\no Parents and students may\nprovide critical information\nregarding student needs.\no Community members may\nprovide excellent support to\nschools in the form of\nvolunteering, career\ndevelopment, mentoring, etc.\no Parental and community\ninvolvement is essential in\nproviding consistency regarding\nroutines and expectations\nthat increase student\noutcomes.\n Promising Partnerships\nPractices\n Home Reading Helper\n U.S. Department of Education\nFamily and Community\nEngagement\n Parent & Kids Magazine\n United Way\n The Campaign for Grade-Level\nReading\n Department of Mental Health\n Mississippi State Department of\nHealth\nMississippi Department of Education\n Family Guides to Student Success\n(Spanish)\n Family Guides to Student Success\n(English)\n Parent & Family Guide to\nUnderstanding Response to\nIntervention\n Parent Support Groups\n Office of Early Childhood\nDepending on cultural expectations, parents/guardians and community members may vary in\ntheir expectations for collaboration, which educators should respect by accommodating\ndifferences to best support learners’ education.

As partnerships are strengthened through collaboration, educators become more\ninformed of student strengths, qualities, learning preferences, and needs.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n22\nCOMPONENT 5\nEVIDENCE-BASED INSTRUCTION,\nINTERVENTION, AND ASSESSMENT\nOverview\nBefore deciding on an educational program, product, or practice, educators should\nidentify practices, instructions, and interventions supported by evidence. Per Section\n8001(21)(A) of The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the term “evidence-based”,\nwhen referring to instructional practices and/or intervention,\nmeans an activity or strategy that-\nA. Demonstrated a statistically significant effect on improving student\noutcomes or other relevant outcomes –\n•\nSTRONG EVIDENCE from at least one well-designed and well-\nimplemented experimental study; OR\n•\nMODERATE EVIDENCE from at least one well-designed and\nwell-implemented quasi-experimental study; OR\n•\nPROMISING EVIDENCE from at least one well-designed and\nwell-implemented correlational study with statistical controls for\nselection bias;\nOR\nB.\nDemonstrates a rationale based on high-quality\nresearch findings or positive evaluation that such activity, strategy, or\nintervention is likely to improve student outcomes or other relevant\noutcomes; and includes ongoing efforts to examine the effects of\nsuch activity, strategy, or intervention.\nESSA defines four levels of evidence. The top three levels require at least one study that\nfound a statistically significant effect on improving student outcomes or other\nrelevant outcomes. The specific level of evidence (1-3) depends on the study’s design:\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n23\nLEVEL\n01\nSTRONG EVIDENCE\n**At least 1 well-designed and well-implemented\nexperimental study (i.e., randomized)\nRequired for all\nTitle I School\nImprovement\nplans\nAND\nEligible for a\npriority under\n7 competitive\ngrants\nLEVEL\n02\nMODERATE EVIDENCE\n**At least 1 well-designed and well-implemented\nquasi-experimental study (i.e., matched)\nLEVEL\n03\nPROMISING EVIDENCE\n**At least 1 well-designed and well implemented\ncorrelational study with statistical controls for\nselection bias\nThe fourth level of evidence includes ideas that do not yet have an evidence base\nqualifying for the top 3 levels. Given the requirement in the 2nd bullet below to examine\nthe effects of these ideas, this level can be referred to as “evidence-building”.\nLEVE\nL\n04\nEVIDENCE-BUILDING\n**Demonstrates a rationale based on high-quality\nresearch or positive evaluation that such activity,\nstrategy, or intervention is likely to improve student\noutcomes or other relevant outcomes\n**Includes ongoing efforts to examine the effects\nof such activity, strategy, or intervention\nIncluded for\nall other uses\nof “evidence-\nbased”\nNOTE: Schools identified as school improvement schools must choose an\nintervention that is Strong, Moderate, or Promising, in order to purchase said\nintervention using federal monies. For further information, refer to MDE’s\nSharing What Works: Supporting Schools - A Framework for Effective\nPractices.\nEvidence-Based Programs\nThe MDE supports school district efforts to invest in proven strategies that have an\nevidence-base for effectiveness toward improving outcomes for children in our schools.\nThe factors that uphold or support the MDE’s position include but are not limited to the\nexpectations and requirements bulleted below.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n24\n•\nState law requires that we categorize all programs and activities based on\nevidence of effectiveness (Miss. Code Ann. § 27-103-159).\n•\nFederal law requires that we select and implement evidence-based\nprograms when using federal funds (ESSA).\n•\nMississippi State Board of Education established the expectation that\nwe are to create a world-class educational system that gives students the\nknowledge and skills to be successful in college and the workforce. To\nobtain this vision, we must use evidence-based practices/programs with a\nproven track record of success.\nIdentifying Evidence-Based Programs\nThe tools below provide districts and schools with guidance for identifying and selecting\nevidence-based interventions that meet the four levels outlined in the ESSA.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n25\nSTEP 01\nIDENTIFY LOCAL NEEDS\n• Identify local needs based on improvement identification.\n• Collect and analyze data (what are data being examined – how do the data\nconnect to the reason for identification).\nSTEP 02\nSELECT RELEVANT, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS\n• What evidence-based strategies or high-quality resource materials are being\nvetted for addressing the cause of identification?\n• How do they align with the school’s current context?\n• Does the evidence demonstrate a positive effect on improving student\noutcomes?

Screeners are typically a form of data collection designed to\nbe quick, and repeatable. Multiple types of data should be collected to assist in a\ncomplete universal screening process. Data from the universal screening process are\nused to make decisions about interventions.\nProgress monitoring is a process used to assess a student’s academic and behavioral\nperformance and measure student improvement or responsiveness to instruction and\nintervention. Progress monitoring can be formal (quantifiable, norm referenced tools)\nor informal (teacher-developed, formative tools) and can be implemented with\nindividual students or an entire class. The frequency of progress monitoring will\nincrease with the intensity of an intervention or additional challenge. Like universal\nscreening, progress monitoring is a process, and therefore data should include multiple\npieces of evidence with a focus on individual student improvement.\nUniversal screening and progress monitoring are central to making educational\ndecisions. Data is used to adjust the intensity and nature of interventions depending on\na student’s responsiveness.\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER\nRESOURCES\no Universal screener for K-3 must be\nchosen from the state approved list.\no For the screening process for 4-12,\nsee the Multi-Tiered System of\nSupports Screening Process Grades\n4-12.\no If using a universal screener tool for\nyour progress monitoring measure,\nensure it aligns with the identified\ndeficit area.\n Establishing Performance\nGoals for Intervention Students\n Progress Monitoring Charts\n Free Graph Maker\n Finding the Right Starting Point for\nReading Interventions: Universal\nScreener Companion Guide, K-3\n MTSS Screening Process Grades\n4-12\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n28\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER (continued)\no Best practices recommendations:\n• Tier II progress monitoring\nshould be completed once\nevery 2 weeks.\n• Tier III progress monitoring\nshould be completed once\nevery week.\no Establish a measurable goal before\nimplementing progress monitoring.\no Progress monitoring results should\nbe graphed or charted against the\nestablished goal in order to\ndetermine student growth.\no Progress monitoring tool measures\nspecific deficit area for which\nstudent is receiving intervention.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n29\nSECTION 4\nImplementing the Tier Process with Fidelity\nThe goal of MTSS is to improve student outcomes for all students. In order to achieve improved\nstudent outcomes, each component of the MTSS framework must be implemented with fidelity.\nFidelity of implementation is the commitment to following all policies and procedures when\ndelivering an intervention. Procedural fidelity, as well as fidelity of implementation, should be\nmeasured regularly.\nFIDELITY CHECKS\nThe MTSS Documentation Packet contains fidelity checks that should occur at regular intervals.\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\nA tool to aid in the fidelity of implementation could include a yearly calendar that will provide a\nschedule for regular screenings, meetings, and data reviews. See Appendix C for a sample\nmonth-by-month MTSS implementation schedule.\nACCREDITATION STANDARDS\nIn order to ensure compliance regarding the intervention process the MDE may monitor the\nfollowing process standard regarding instructional practices:\n20. The school district meets the following instructional management requirements\n{Miss. Code Ann. §§ 37-3- 49(2)(a-c) and 37-3-49(5)} (7 Miss. Admin. Code Pt. 3,\nCh. 41, R. 41.1):\n20.1\nThe school district implements an instructional management\nsystem that has been adopted by the school board and includes,\nat a minimum, the competencies and objectives required in\nthe curriculum frameworks approved by the State Board of\nEducation that are available to all teachers in each school.\n(Districts Meeting the Highest Levels of Performance\nare exempted.)\n20.2 The instructional management system\nincludes a tiered instructional model in\naccordance with (7 Miss. Admin. Code\nPt. 3, Ch. 41, R. 41.1), including academic\ninterventions, behavioral interventions,\nand Literacy-Based Promotion Act\nrequirements.\nRESOURCES\n MTSS Documentation\nPacket\n Multi-Tiered System of\nSupport Fidelity of\nImplementation Rubric\n Self-Assessment of MTSS\nImplementation (SAM)\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n30\nSECTION 5\nHigh-Quality Tier I Core Instruction\nTier I, high-quality, core instruction is present at all three levels of the tiered model and should\ninclude the adoption and use of an evidence-based curriculum that is aligned to the Mississippi\nCollege- and Career-Readiness Standards (MCCRS). Tier I instruction should include the use of\na developmentally appropriate universal screener for academics and behavior. The data\nobtained from the universal screening assessments, as well as formative and summative\nassessments, should be used to inform instruction and lesson plan development. Instruction\nshould be differentiated and scaffolded based on the specific needs of students. During Tier I,\nstudents must be given time to observe explicit modeling of new concepts and skills that are\nintroduced as well as allowed time for guided practice, and independent practice of the newly\nintroduced skills. Effective classroom management, active student engagement, and positive\nbehavioral supports are key components of Tier I instruction. With effective high quality\ninstruction, approximately 80% of students’ needs are met at the Tier I level, therefore Tier I is\nthe first level of prevention.\nQUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS\nOF TIER I INSTRUCTION\n•\nWhat percentage of students are achieving academic\nand behavioral expectations?\n•\nWhat percentage of students in subgroups are\nachieving academic and behavioral expectations?\n•\nAre the classroom and school environments\nconducive to learning?\n•\nAre systems in place to ensure quality classroom\ninstruction?\n•\nIs implementation of culturally responsive practices\nin place?\nRESOURCES\n MDE 2019 Access for\nAll Guide\n Tennessee Department of\nEducation Access Materials\n Kentucky Department\nof Education – Differentiated\nInstruction\n Reading Next – A Vision\nfor Action and Research\nin Middle and High\nSchool Literacy\n Positive Behavior\nInterventions and\nSupports OSEP Technical\nAssistance Center\n Universal Design\nfor Learning\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n31\nSECTION 6\nTier II Supplemental Instruction\nTier II (typically 10-15% of the population) is supplemental, targeted academic and/or\nbehavioral instruction that is provided in addition to the core instruction. Tier II interventions\nare designed for students who have not positively responded to Tier I efforts, instruction, and/or\nbehavior management within the general classroom. It is recommended that a hearing screening\nand a vision screening take place at Tier II to rule out an underlying problem that might be\ncausing lack of progress at Tier I. Within this tier of intervention support, the teacher typically\nprovides additional instructional support aligned to core lessons. The interventions are carefully\ndeveloped using various instructional planning resources. Tier II interventions should focus on\nspecific, identified skill gaps, and they should be closely monitored. Tier II interventions should\nbe data-driven and follow a progression of skills. The interventions should be scaffolded based\non the individual needs of the student. Intervention sessions should be conducted one-on-one or\nin a small group setting for 20-30 minutes 3-5 days per week. Key instructional features that\ncharacterize Tier II intervention sessions are differentiated instruction, modeling, multiple\nstudent responses, and immediate feedback. Students receiving Tier II should be progress\nmonitored minimally every other week (twice a month). Regular fidelity checks should be\nadministered at equal intervals to ensure implementation of the intervention is carried out\nwith integrity.\nThe MDE recommends that a documented review occurs at 4 weeks and again\nat 8 weeks after implementation of Tier II.\nREFERRAL TO TST\nA student should be referred to the Teacher Support Team (TST) if progress monitoring data\ndoes not show adequate student progress and further support is needed. Additionally, students\nwho populate the MSIS screen for one of the following indicators must be referred to TST within\nthe first 20 days of school.\n1. Grades K–3: Student has failed one grade. Grades 4–12: Student has failed two grades.\n2. A student failed either of the preceding two grades and has been suspended or expelled\nfor more than 20 days in the current school year.\n3. A student who did not score at the required achievement level on any part of the Grade 3\nor Grade 7 statewide accountability assessment.\n4. A student is promoted from Grade 3 to Grade 4 under a good cause exemption of the\nLiteracy-Based Promotion Act.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n32\nSECTION 7\nTier III Intensive Interventions\nTier III (typically 1-5% of population) provides the most intensive, targeted instruction\nspecifically designed to meet the individual needs of the student. Tier III instruction should be\ndesigned to increase an individual student’s rate of progress, close deficit gaps between the\nstudent and their peers, based on the student’s need as determined by assessment data\n(universal screenings, hearing and vision screenings, diagnostic assessments, progress\nmonitoring, etc.) and aligned to the core curricula. Intensive interventions should be evidence-\nbased, taught explicitly and systematically, and judiciously monitored for fidelity during\nimplementation. Intensive instruction is provided in small groups or on an individual basis as\ndictated by the collected data. Tier III intervention should occur:\n•\nas outlined by the intervention program,\n•\nin accordance with the individualized plan, or\n•\nfor 30-60 minutes daily.\nTier III interventions should be progressed monitored weekly (one data point per week). Also, it\nshould be determined that a student’s lack of growth is not due to a hearing or vision problem\nthat may be keeping him/her from mastering skills.\nThe MDE recommends two (2) Tier III documented reviews, with the first documented\nreview conducted no later than eight (8) weeks after implementation and the\ncumulative documented review no later than sixteen (16) weeks after implementation.\nNEXT STEPS (INTERVENTIONS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL)\nWhen data is reviewed and analyzed, a decision should be made regarding the success of the\nintervention plan. If it is concluded that the intervention plan was not successful the TST must\ndecide if the intervention should be revised, goals adjusted, or the student should be referred to\nthe Multidisciplinary Evaluation Team (MET) for a Child Find Study. (Note: A referral to the\nMET may be requested at any time, by anyone, for any student. The MTSS process is not a\nprereferral for the evaluation process.)\nCHILD FIND\nChild Find requires all school districts to identify, locate and evaluate all children with\ndisabilities, regardless of the severity of their disabilities. School districts are required to identify\nall children who may need special education services even if the school is not providing special\neducation services to the child. Schools are required to locate, identify and evaluate all children\nwith disabilities from age 3 to age 21. The Child Find mandate applies to all children who reside\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n33\nwithin the state, including children who attend private schools and public schools, highly mobile\nchildren, migrant children, homeless children, and children who are wards of the state.\nStudents suspected of having a disability that are identified through Child Find continue to\nreceive high quality classroom instruction and supports for academics and behavior. All requests\nfor comprehensive assessments for children suspected of having a disability should be\nsubmitted immediately to the district’s special education director, school administrator or the\nMultidisciplinary Evaluation Team. Written consent for the evaluation must be obtained from\nthe parent prior to the assessment.\nThe MTSS process cannot be used to deny, delay, or negate in any way the\nappropriate evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability.\nIDEA does not require all students go through the MTSS process prior to a comprehensive\nassessment. Students eligible for special education services after comprehensive assessments\nwill have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) put in place. Students that are not eligible\nfor an IEP will return to the MTSS process and may be eligible for a 504 plan.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n34\nSECTION 8\nBehavior\nIn MTSS, behavioral instruction and intervention is one layer provided in the continuum of\nsupports for Tiers I, II, III. The Positive Behavioral Supports and Interventions (PBIS)\nframework provides guidelines and suggestions for each tier.\nTier I includes best practices that should be school, program, and/or facility wide and included\nin every classroom. Developing school, program, or facility wide expectations, classroom/area\nrules, a reinforcement and consequence system, and a consistent office discipline referral (ODR)\nsystem is the beginning of implementing Tier I supports. Teaching the developed expectations\nand rules as well as classroom and area procedures is the second step in implementing Tier I\nsupports. Analyzing data from ODRs and other linked data sources and sharing this data with\nstaff, students, families, and the community in order to plan for and make changes as needed is\nthe last step in implementing Tier I supports. The REACH MS website resource section contains\nforms, checklists, case studies, examples, etc. for Tier I implementation.\nTier II includes best practices for those students who are not making progress with Tier I\nsupports. Unsuccessful behaviors are not only those external behaviors like physical aggression\nand not following rules (i.e., running in the hallway, repeatedly out of seat) and norms/laws\n(i.e., stealing, truancy) but also includes other, less noticeable external behaviors and internal\nbehaviors. These less noticeable behaviors include off-task behavior, not completing\nassignments, difficulty with peer relationships, sleeping in class, etc. Behavioral interventions\nat Tier II include an individualized reinforcement and consequence system (i.e., where\nstudents need fewer positive behaviors to earn reinforcement), check-in and check-out, check\nand connect, behavioral contracting, teaching of social emotional skills, organizational aides,\nand increasing executive functioning through games, breaks, etc. A targeted support plan that\nincludes specific intervention recommendations is encouraged. The REACH MS website\nresource section contains forms, checklists, case studies, examples, etc. for\nTier II implementation.\nTier III includes best practices for students who are not making progress with Tier II supports.\nThe supports provided at Tier III should be individualized to each student. In order to provide\nindividualized supports, it is important to understand the function(s) of a student’s behavior(s).\nWithout determining the function of a behavior, it is difficult to develop individualized\ninterventions. Though not required by law, functional behavioral assessments (FBA) provide\ninformation from multiple sources in the form of observations, interviews, and anecdotal notes.\nThe data collected through FBAs make it possible to develop function based behavior support\nplans (BSP), individualized to each student. BSPs define the target behavior(s), provide\ninformation on current behavior(s), and detail interventions to use in order to assist the student\nin meeting the target behavior(s). At a minimum, observation(s) notes should be used to create a\nBSP that lists possible interventions to use. Behavioral interventions at Tier III include\nindividualized reinforcement and consequence systems with specific reinforcement options\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n35\ngathered through an interest inventory or observation, individualized schedules, replacement\nbehaviors, etc. The REACH MS website resource section contains forms, checklists, case studies,\nexamples, etc. for Tier III implementation.\nFor students who are in Tiers II or III due to behavioral needs, it is important to determine the\namount of behavioral support needed versus the need for both academic and behavioral support\nas many inappropriate behaviors are exhibited due to struggles with academic work (in length,\nin difficulty, in type of assignment, etc.). For example, a student who talks to and disturbs others\nat the end of whole groups may do so because his attention timespan has ended. Another\nstudent may become angry or upset at the difficulty of a math worksheet and have verbal\noutbursts or kick chairs. These students may be provided with both academic and behavioral\ninterventions.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n36\nSECTION 9\nCounselors Role in MTSS\nThe American School Counselor Association (ASCA) supports counselors as stakeholders in the\ndevelopment and implementation of a MTSS. School counselors play a significant role in\nsupporting positive student behavior and academic success by participating as members of the\nshared leadership team, coordinating and implementing the school’s behavior intervention\nsystems, facilitating Tier I behavior screeners, and providing group and individual counseling, to\npromote equity for all students. By implementing a comprehensive school counseling program\ndesigned to affect student development in the academic domain (achievement), the career\ndomain (career exploration and development) and the social/emotional domain (behavior),\nschool counselors align their work to MTSS.\nASCA MODEL\nTIERS\nOF LEARNING SUPPORTS\nEXAMPLES\nOF LEARNING SUPPORTS\nTier 1: Universal Core Instructional\nInterventions for All Students,\nPreventative\nand Proactive\n1.

Individual Reading Plans (IRP) should be created for Kindergarten and 1st -\n3rd grade students with a substantial reading deficiency, as well as students who passed to 4th\ngrade with a Good Cause Exemption. The TST will determine if a student’s data supports that a\nreading deficiency is present, at which time an IRP will be created.\nThe IRP correlates with, and can be documented in\nconjunction with, the MTSS Documentation Packet as\nlong as ALL seven (7) components are completed.\nWhen creating an IRP the TST must utilize each student’s\nINDIVIDUAL data to determine skill deficiencies and\ndeficit areas. Plans for targeted instruction and\nintervention must be specific to the INDIVIDUAL student.\nIt is recommended that Section F: Parental Support\nPlan/Parent Read-at-Home Plan is reviewed with a\nparent/guardian to ensure the understanding of strategies\nand allow for questioning and clarification of how to help\nthe student at home.\nRESOURCES\n Literacy Based Promotion\nAct FAQ\n Mississippi Comprehensive\nLiteracy Plan\n Developing an IRP Webinar\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n41\nSECTION 12\nUtilizing the Documentation Packet\nThe MTSS Documentation Packet was created to assist districts, schools, and educators with the\ndocumentation and implementation of interventions as well as the Literacy-Based Promotion\nAct (LBPA). The packet provides the means to reflect on policies and practices at the classroom,\nschool, and district level in order to continually improve student outcomes. The packet is\norganized according to the following sections:\n•\nStudent Profile Sheet (PreK, K-8, 9-12)\n•\nTier I High Quality Classroom Observation\n•\nTier II (Supplemental Instruction) Documentation\n•\nTeacher Support Team (TST) Referral and Meeting\n•\nTier III (Intensive Intervention) Documentation\n•\nAppendices\n•\nRecommendations for Documentation\nPer State Board Policy 41.1, school districts must complete, at a minimum, documentation as\nrequired for all students in Tier II or Tier III. All Tier III documentation must accompany the\nstudent’s cumulative folder upon promotion or transfer to a new school.\nFor detailed information on how to complete and utilize documentation, review the MTSS\nDocumentation Packet.\nThe MDE recommends that hearing and vision screening is administered for students\nat Tier II. It is required that hearing and vision screenings occur annually (once every\ntwelve (12) months) for all Tier III students. The screener results should be recorded\nin the MTSS Documentation Packet.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n42\nSECTION 13\nUtilizing Universal Screeners and\nDiagnostic Assessments to Identify Deficit Areas\nUniversal screeners are an integral component of the MTSS process as they provide a piece of\nthe data required for the decision making process. Once screeners are administered, results\nshould be compared to other classroom assessments that may include but are not limited to:\nstandards-based assessments, grades, formative assessments, summative assessments,\nclassroom performance, and teacher observations. These assessments are used to either\nconfirm or challenge the results of the universal screener and determine next steps. Students\nidentified as “at-risk” based on multiple pieces of data should be administered diagnostic or\nsurvey level assessments to determine specific intervention needs.\nIn grades K-3, universal screening assessments will be\nadministered to all students at least three times during the\nyear, with exception to students in grade 3 who are not\nidentified for intervention on mid-year screeners. These\nstudents are not required to take the end of the year screener.\nResults of these screeners provide an especially critical “first\nlook” at individual students. State statute requires that\ndistricts select an approved screener from the list provided\n(Mississippi Code § 37-23-16; Mississippi Code § 37-177-5).\nDyslexia screeners are mandated in the spring for\nKindergarten students and the fall for students in grade 1\nutilizing a State Board of Education approved screener.\nThese screeners will aid in providing valuable information in\nthe areas of: phonological awareness, phonemic awareness,\nalphabet knowledge, decoding, encoding, and rapid naming.\nRESOURCES\n Finding the Right Starting\nPoint for Reading\nInterventions\n Student Assessment K-3\nUniversal Screeners\n Intervention Services Dyslexia\nScreener Information\n Intervention Services 4-12\nScreener Information\n Diagnostic Tools\n Math Mammoth\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n43\nSECTION 14\nAdditional Considerations\nEARLY CHILDHOOD\nMany school districts are putting practices in place to provide support in pre-k rather than\nmoving directly to sending referrals to special education. Implementing MTSS in pre-k is\nencouraged; however, providing at least one intervention and administering a second screener\nbefore a referral is made to special education for those students with a smaller gap is strongly\nrecommended. Many school districts are not evaluating pre-k students who are referred to\nspecial education due to a lack of data. It is important that all pre-k students participate in the\nstate kindergarten readiness assessment; use the Mississippi Early Learning Standards\nChecklist for Classrooms for Four-Year-Olds for each child; and use other sources of data such\nas curriculum assessments, district behavioral screeners, and developmental measures. Simply\ndocumenting the frequency and duration of behaviors is helpful.\nIn 2017, Mississippi began its first stage in the implementation of the Pyramid Model for pre-k\nprograms within and outside of school districts. The Pyramid Model is a three-tiered framework\nthat aligns with positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) and the three tiers in the\nlayered continuum of MTSS supports.\nTier I supports include academic and behavioral best practices found in high-quality early\nchildhood classrooms. The development of expectations and rules is included in Tier I just as it\nis for K-12. Tier I in the Pyramid Model also addresses intentional teaching of relational skills,\nthe importance of interactions specifically positive ones, classroom arrangement, classroom\ndesign, learning centers, schedules, transitions, large and small groups, and giving directions.\nTier II supports are mostly geared towards best practices in teaching social emotional skills with\nthe rationale that the root of most inappropriate behavior in pre-k is a lack of social emotional\nskill development. Tier II in the Pyramid Model breaks down social skills into friendship and\nproblem-solving skills and includes both positive and negative emotions with intentional focus\non the teaching of these social emotional skills. Free printable, social stories, book lists with\nactivities, resources for teaching emotions, and resources for supporting problem solving can be\nfound at the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning.\nTier III supports include behavioral best practices for those few children in a pre-k program who\nare unable to exhibit successful behaviors with high-quality pre-k school programming and\nsocial emotional skill teaching alone. Much like the K-12 PBIS practices, Tier III in pre-k\nincludes conducting Functional Behavioral Assessments (FBAs) and creating behavior support\nplans (BSPs). Specific focus is given to determining the form and function of behavior, using\nprevention strategies, and implementing replacement behaviors.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n44\nDYSLEXIA\nDistricts must accept dyslexia evaluations administered by a licensed psychologist,\npsychometrist, or speech language pathologist. Students with a dyslexia diagnosis might also\nreceive intervention services and/or qualify for an IEP through IDEA, however not all students\nwith dyslexia will need additional supports. Some students with dyslexia are successful when\nreceiving high-quality Tier 1 instruction along with some general accommodations.\nThe appropriate supports to put in place for a student with dyslexia should be determined by the\nTST utilizing data-based problem solving.\nState Testing Accommodations for Students with Dyslexia (2017)\nAllowable accommodations for students with dyslexia include 20/23, 24, and 25 for all\nMississippi Academic Assessment Program tests (ELA and math for grades 3-8, 5 and\n8 science, U.S. History, English II, Algebra I, and Biology I) as well as MKAS2, English\nProficiency Test and ACT.

These accommodations must be listed in the student’s IEP\nor Section 504 Plan and specified for these assessment areas or students must have a\ndocumented diagnosis of dyslexia on file in accordance with Miss. Code 37-173-1 et seq.\nSource: Appendix B, 2017 Mississippi Testing Accommodations Manual\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n45\nClassroom Accommodations\nThese are some allowable classroom accommodations for\nstudents with dyslexia. Accommodations should be put in\nplace, AS NEEDED.\n•\nAllow extra time for completing tests\n•\nShorten assignments\n•\nProvide audio books\n•\nProvide a copy of the notes\n•\nReduce homework load\n•\nReduce copying tasks\nScreening Kindergarten and First Grade Students for Dyslexia\nDistricts are required to adopt a local school board policy regarding screening students\nfor dyslexia in the fall of 1st grade and the spring of Kindergarten. Students must be\nscreened using a State Board approved screener. If a student does not pass the screener,\nparents/guardians must be notified. It is important that districts help parents/guardians\nto understand that a dyslexia screener simply identifies the existence of potential\ncharacteristics for dyslexia and is not an assessment that provides an official diagnosis of\ndyslexia. Screener information and results are to be submitted, as instructed each year,\nto the Office of Intervention Services.\nDIFFERENTIATION THROUGHOUT THE TIERS, ACCOMMODATIONS,\nAND MODIFICATIONS\nThe purpose of differentiated instruction is to teach to student differences while working toward\nthe same desired outcome for all students. The process of differentiated instruction allows\neducators to meet the needs of all students within the same classroom. Differentiation must be\npurposeful as lessons are scaffolded to meet students on their level and work to help students\nmeet the MCCRS.\nWhen providing classroom accommodations and\nmodifications, it is crucial that the intent of the standard\nremains intact. The MDE Access for ALL Guide provides\nguidance to teachers and administrators that will help\npromote equal access to grade-level content for both\ngeneral education students and students with disabilities\nwho receive instruction in the general education classroom.\nRESOURCE\n Access for All Guide\nRESOURCES\n Dyslexia Screener\nInformation and Forms\n 2017 Mississippi Testing\nAccommodations Manual\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n46\nMTSS AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL\nThe goals of MTSS at the secondary levels are similar to\nthose of the elementary levels in that by providing\nappropriate instruction and intervention, districts are\nmeeting the needs of a diverse student population and\nimproving outcomes for ALL students. However, MTSS\ngoals differ somewhat at the secondary level as students\nconsider graduation options and begin to consider post-\ngraduation plans and long-term goals. Though long-term\ngoals differ for some students, Every Student Graduates\nHigh School Ready for College and Career remains a\ntargeted goal for Mississippi students. MTSS provides a\nsystematic process through which schools can improve\neducational approaches by integrating evidence-based\npractices across the content areas.\nTo meet the objectives of MTSS at the secondary level,\nit is important to look at the initiatives that are currently\nin place within a school/district and discuss how those initiatives, and State Board Policy 41.1,\nmay be aligned to work together as a cohesive unit promoting academic, behavioral, and social-\nemotional growth among students by way of enhanced student learning.\nCritical elements of enhanced learning and student success are motivation and engagement\ntherefore, interventions at the secondary level will require a comprehensive approach that\naddresses the whole student. Literacy development that can be generalized across content areas\nsupports student engagement and motivation. When schools use consistent literacy approaches\nacross content areas students are able to focus more easily on comprehension and content,\ntherefore, increasing engagement.\nSPECIAL EDUCATION\nStudents with a special education eligibility receive services as outlined on their Individualized\nEducation Program (IEP). The IEP Committee is responsible for determining and documenting\nwhat services the student requires in order to be successful and that he/she be provided a Free\nAppropriate Public Education (FAPE).\nStudents with a special education eligibility in language/speech in the areas of articulation, voice\nand fluency would not typically need additional academic or behavioral supports in the\nclassroom. However, it is common for a student with an eligibility of language/speech -\nlanguage impaired to need additional supports. The IEP Committee may decide to add goals to\nthe IEP to address the student’s deficits or place the student in Tier II or Tier III in order to\nreceive supplemental instruction. It is important to remember that the student’s deficit skills,\nnot the eligibility determination, dictate the services needed to provide a FAPE.\nRESOURCES\n MCCRS Scaffolding\nDocuments for ELA\nand Mathematics\n Problem Analysis Within\nan RTI Framework at\nSecondary School\n Center on Response to\nIntervention, Secondary\nSchools\n Tiered Interventions in\nHigh School\n Mississippi Early\nWarning System\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n47\nSPEECH/LANGUAGE\nThe speech/language pathologist may conduct interventions with students who have\narticulation, voice, fluency or language deficits before they are identified as a student with a\ndisability. There are ways to fund this activity that would allow the SLP to provide both\nprevention and rehabilitation services, including using Coordinated Early Intervening Service\nfunds or partially funding with MAEP teacher units.\nSECTION 504\nSection 504 is a federal law designed to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities in\nprograms and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from the U.S. Department\nof Education (ED). Section 504 provides: \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability\nin the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\nprogram or activity receiving federal financial assistance . . . \"\nThe Office of Civil Rights enforces Section 504 in programs and activities that receive federal\nfinancial assistance from ED. Recipients of this federal financial assistance include public\nschool districts, institutions of higher education, and other state and local education\nagencies. The regulations implementing Section 504 in the context of educational\ninstitutions appear at 34 C.F.R. Part 104.\nThe Section 504 regulations require a school district to provide a \"free appropriate public\neducation\" (FAPE) to each qualified student with a disability who is in the school district's\njurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability. Under Section 504, FAPE\nconsists of the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services\ndesigned to meet the student's individual educational needs as adequately as the needs of\nnondisabled students are met.\nA Section 504 Plan is a plan developed to ensure that a student who has a disability\nidentified under the law and is attending an elementary or secondary educational institution\nreceives accommodations that will ensure their academic success and access to the learning\nenvironment.\nSection 504 requires recipients to provide to students with disabilities appropriate\neducational services designed to meet the individual needs of such students to the same\nextent as the needs of students without disabilities are met. An appropriate education for a\nstudent with a disability under the Section 504 regulations could consist of education in\nregular classrooms, education in regular classes with supplementary services, and/or special\neducation and related services.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n48\nThe U.S. Department of Education enforces Section 504 and additional information is\navailable on their website.\nGIFTED STUDENTS\nThe state definition of intellectually gifted children in\nMississippi shall mean those children and youth who are\nfound to have an exceptionally high degree of intelligence\nas documented through the identification process. Service to\nidentified intellectually gifted children in grades two (2)\nthrough six (6) is mandated by law. In situations where a\nstudent is identified as gifted and also identified as a student\nin need of academic or behavioral intervention, such services\nshould be provided as needed. Districts should abide by\nstandards regarding required number of minutes of gifted\ninstruction each week, per the 2013 Regulations for Gifted\nEducation Programs. In the even of an extended closure,\ndistricts should refer to the Exended Closure Guidance to\ncontinue the identification of and service to gifted children.\nENGLISH LEARNERS\nTier I\nImplementation of high-quality, Tier I core instruction which utilizes best practices is\nessential to the success of our English learners. (ELs).\nIt is essential that all teachers who work with ELs receive training on best practices for\ninstructing ELs, Tier I instructional strategies to support English language acquisition,\nas well as grade level college and career readiness standards. See the MDE English\nLearner Guidelines as well as the MDE English Learner page for resources, tips and\nvideos for instructing English learners. See the MDE Guidance on Extended Distance\nLearning for English Learners for ways to address the four language domains, adapt\nbest practices, and other tools for supporting Els in a distance learning setting.\nWhen considering a referral to intervention for English learners the TST should\nconsider the following information:\n•\nAmount of time the student has been in this country: In addition to\nlearning a new language, newly arrived EL students need time to adjust to\nthe new culture and expectations in our school systems,\n•\nSimilarity or dissimilarity of ethnicity or national origin to that of the U.S.,\nand the type of schooling they attended in their native country, and\nRESOURCES\n RTI and the Gifted Student\n Gifted Students, Gifted\nServices, and Response to\nIntervention\n National Association for\nGifted Children\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n49\n•\nDegree of English language acquisition-students with lower levels of\nEnglish proficiency will require more supports and scaffolds to support\ncontent area learning.\nBefore implementing interventions for ELs remember to:\n•\nConsult with parents, general education teacher, EL teacher and all other\nteachers who work with the student,\n•\nExamine all the data (state tests, English Learner Proficiency Test (ELPT),\nuniversal screeners, diagnostic assessments, classroom performance, etc.)\nAND\n•\nDetermine the specific deficit and select an intervention that will best\naddress the deficit area.\nWhen meeting to determine the need for intervention for ELs, team members to include\nin the initial and subsequent TST meetings should include at a minimum, the general\neducation teacher, content area teacher for area of struggle, the EL teacher/coordinator,\nintervention teacher, student’s parent/guardian and an administrator.\nUsing the Data\nWhile EL students may be in the lower 25th percentile of MAAP, universal screeners,\nand benchmark scores, it is essential that ELPT scores are also examined to determine\nstudent’s progress towards English language proficiency. For information on\nunderstanding these reports see the EL Literacy Focus of the Month video for August.\nWhen determining if an EL student needs intervention, the TST should be sure that they\nconsider all relevant available data including:\n1. MAAP scores\n2. Universal screener scores\n3. Benchmark scores\n4. Classroom grades\n5. ELPT scores\nConsideration of all data including ELPT assessment data should be examined to\ndetermine if the struggles are due primarily to academic, behavioral or English language\ndeficiencies. If language acquisition is lower than that of EL peers from the same\nlanguage background who have been in the US for the same amount of time as well as\nacademic and/or behavioral struggles, the student may need intervention as defined in\nthe MTSS process. Specific LAS Links reports to refer to are the Student Profile Report\nand the Roster Report which can be sorted according to score in ascending, or\ndescending, order. Consider the scenarios, developed by the United States Department\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n50\nof Education, to help make decisions about interventions for English learners which are\nfound in the MDE’s English Learner Guidelines on page 116.\nCultural Considerations\nKeep in mind that students from backgrounds that are significantly different than that of\nthe United States may have a more difficult time adjusting to life and schools in the\nU.S. It is therefore essential that, prior to conferencing with the parents, the TST\nand EL teacher conduct basic research in order to better understand the cultural norms\nof the student’s birth country, and avoid cultural biases, when making decisions about\nthe need for intervention.\nInterrupted Schooling\nMany EL students come from an interrupted schooling background which may include\nthe following reasons:\n•\nThey are newcomers with two or more years of interrupted education in\ntheir native country.\n•\nThey have attended school in the U.S., returned to their native country for a\nperiod of time, then returned to the U.S. again.\n•\nThey have attended kindergarten in English (L2), 1st and 2nd grade in their\nfirst language (L1), then jumped into 3rd grade with instruction in English.\n•\nThey have attended U.S. schools since kindergarten but have language and\nliteracy gaps due to ineffective instruction.\n•\nThey have attended school in one location for a few months, then moved to\nanother location for a few months, and perhaps had some weeks in between\nthese changes when they did not attend school (Calderón, 2008).”\nThese issues present a plethora of potential academic and behavioral issues, which may\nneed to be addressed through the MTSS process. Determination for an EL student’s\nplacement must take into consideration the degree of deficiency, as well as the specific\nacademic and behavioral deficiency area(s) that will be addressed. Proper\ndocumentation for Tier II or Tier III should take place using the MTSS Documentation\nPacket.\nFor additional information, and sample student scenarios, to help guide decisions\nregarding interventions for English learners, see the MDE English Learner Guidelines.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n51\nSECTION 15\nScheduling Intervention Time\nIt is important that schools align schedules to ensure that they are providing high-quality\nclassroom instruction, reflecting current practices and policy requirements, as well as providing\nample time for intervention supports for individual students.\nFor optimal student outcomes within a MTSS, there must be adequate time for instruction based\non students’ needs. Developing an effective schedule is a process in which many stakeholders\nneed to be included. Schedules should be reviewed and revised as needed.\nTier I Scheduling Guidance\n•\nInclude both whole group and small group instruction (PreK-12)\n•\nDifferentiate instruction based on student needs\n•\nAdhere to State Accountability Standards and District Policy regarding required\ninstructional minutes\nScheduling Approaches for Elementary Schools\nWithin the Classroom\nTier II Interventions may be carried out within the classroom by the classroom teacher\nor other staff members who are highly trained in the intervention. Small groups, or\nindividual students, can be pulled during center time or while students are doing\nindependent practice.\nWalk-to-Learn\nWalk-to-Learn classes are re-grouped across a team or grade level to form groups based\non needs. On grade level students are provide enrichment by classroom teachers or\nother personnel. Students receiving Tier II intervention are provided interventions by\nother classroom teachers while students receiving Tier III are provided interventions by\nthe most highly qualified teachers, if no interventionist is on staff.\nScheduling Approaches for Middle School and High School\n30 Minute Period/Block\nDuring this 30 minute period of time all students are scheduled with a teacher for\nintervention, remediation, or enrichment. All staff including special subject teachers,\npara-professionals, counselors, etc., are needed to help carry out this plan successfully.\nThis can be scheduled in one of 3 ways:\n•\nSix 50 or 55 minute periods with one 30 minute period, OR\n•\nSeven 45 or 47 minute periods with a 30 minute period, OR\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n52\n•\nFour 85 minute blocks with one 30 minute block.\nElective Course\nDuring these courses direct instruction takes place beyond that of the required ELA and\nmathematics courses. Computer-based programs may be used for a portion of the time\nif they are evidence-based, aligned with the deficit area, and delivered with fidelity.\nThese classes should have a smaller student/teacher ratio than those of other classes.\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER\nRESOURCES\no Where should the time come from\nto create the intervention time?\no Where in the schedule should Tier\nII and Tier III occur?\no Middle Schools and High\nSchools: How many periods\nshould be scheduled?\no What resources are required to\nachieve your scheduling goal?\n Making It Happen:\nWhat Does It Take to Implement\nIntensive Intervention?\n Implementing RTI: Developing\nEffective Schedules at the\nElementary Level\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n53\nSECTION 16\nMTSS and Diversity\nA properly developed and implemented MTSS meets the diverse needs of ALL learners. Each\ncomponent of MTSS allows opportunities for providing appropriate supports as needed. Since\nMTSS is NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL model, student’s unique experiences and backgrounds\nshould provide starting points for establishing academic and behavioral intervention goals,\nrather than serving as “after thoughts” once interventions are in place. Validation and\naffirmation of each student’s strengths, life experiences, cultural background, and education is\nkey to creating a positive school culture and climate where ALL individuals feel safe and\nrespected, making learning more relevant and engaging for each student.\nDevelopment Stage\nRelevance to MTSS and IEP\nDevelopment and Implementation\nCultural\nDestructiveness\nCultural diversity is viewed as a highly negative\naspect and is excluded totally from MTSS and IEPs.\nCultural Incapacity\nCultural diversity is viewed indifferently, ignored, and\ngiven little if any credibility in the implementation of\nMTSS and IEPs.\nCultural Blindness\nExistence of cultural diversity is acknowledged yet is\nviewed as having little significance in the\nimplementation of MTSS or IEP development and\nimplementation.\nCultural Precompetence\nCultural diversity is valued as evidenced through\ngreater personal awareness and sensitivity with some,\nalthough limited, applications within MTSS and IEP\ndevelopment and implementation.\nCultural Competence\nPerceptions about cultural diversity move from\nawareness and sensitivity to application and\nincorporation within MTSS and IEP development and\nimplementation.\nCultural Proficiency\nCultural diversity is significantly embedded into MTSS\nand IEP development and implementation including\nboth general and special education at the\nschool/district levels.\nCultural and linguistic diversity (CLD) does not cease to be integral to diverse\nstudents’ teaching and learning once they are placed in special education.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n54\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER\no Understanding CLD aids in avoidance of\npre-labeling a student with a learning\ndisability (allowing adequate opportunities\nto learn).\no Are data collection procedures appropriate\nfor diverse groups?\no Leadership teams should consist of\nmembers who are knowledgeable of\nCLD learners.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n55\nSECTION 17\nInterventions through Distance Learning\nProviding intervention, accommodations, or modifications through distance learning requires\ncollaboration among family and school staff as intervention plans are created and modified\naccording to student needs. It is necessary to focus on essential skills needed for student success\nwhile understanding that lessons will be different from those provided face to face in the school\nsetting.\nSchool teams play an important role in helping students to adjust to distance learning as\nwell as assisting with identification of learning opportunities that exist in daily routines.\nWith some fine tuning of daily routines and creativity, intervention lessons may occur while\nother family duties are carried out. If the family schedules make it too stressful for parents\nand educators to connect during the day, this might take place after hours during a more\nfocused time.\nKeep in mind that the goal is to continue skill building which requires student motivation and\ndedication of the student, family, and school staff. Intervention lessons should be stress-free\nlearning periods in which students are engaged and focused.\nThis is an unprecedented time where flexibility and creativity are required to provide the best\ninterventions for the students in Mississippi. The key is to ensure that the students are\ncontinuing to receive the supports they need to be successful. This can be done through planning\nand communication while practicing all precautions advised by the Health Department or CDC,\nwhen applicable.\nHOW TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WITH THE MOST NEED\nIdentify students that have the most need and ensure that they have access to the available\ninterventions. This can be done through a diagnostic assessment. A diagnostic can be utilized to\ndiscover what types of intensive support is needed for each individual student. This information\nshould identify the specific gaps the student is exhibiting and provide information on the deficit\narea that should be addressed through distance learning.  \nWhat can interventions look like with distance learning? \n•\nIn-person Learning: small group interventions with explicit instruction in\nthe deficit area may continue as designed to ensure a tiered level of support\nis delivered to all students.\n•\nAt-home Learning: communicate with families the importance of\nstudents completing the assessments/assignments on their own. Help\nparents understand that teachers are using this information to design the\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n56\nintervention that will best meet the students’ needs.  Below are additional\nresources that can be used at home to address the identified deficiency.\n•\nHybrid Learning: complete assessments, including diagnostics, together\nin a one-on-one or small group setting. Students can be provided\ninstruction during the face-to-face setting and then practice from\nhome virtually. Progress monitoring may be conducted digitally with a\nvirtual proctor that can sit with the student as they are completing\nthe assignment or assessment.\nWhatever the learning situation, interventions and supports will continue for the\nstudents. Find what works for you as the interventionist and the students you are\nserving. Keeping in mind that while you are addressing grade level content you are also\naddressing the gaps that have been identified. \nHow can students benefit from distance learning? \n•\nThis is a time where we can make the foundation stronger for the students,\nusing a blended strategy of grade appropriate work and fill in the gaps along\nthe way. \n•\nStudents can connect what is occurring in interventions to what\nis occurring in the classroom during Tier I instruction.\n•\nTeachers can provide positive intervention experiences through technology\nand using various means to connect with students.  \nTips  \nRemain focused on the child and provide support that will benefit their overall success\nfor the future.  \nThe interventionist should reach out to each parent so they understand what will be\nconducted during the intervention time.  \nChoose an appropriate intervention to be conducted. This should be an intervention\nthat the parents can easily access at home.    \nThe interventionist should conduct a parent training, so the parents understand\nthe components of the intervention program. This is an opportunity to demonstrate the\nimportance of students completing their work on their own.    \nThe quality of the assignments should provide meaningful work with scaffolding\nprovided as needed for the student.   \nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n57\nUtilize a systematic approach with instruction. Identify the areas of need and develop a\nplan for instruction.   \nIncorporate other subject areas to expose students to rich content areas, build\nvocabulary, fluency, and knowledge. Writing should be part of daily/weekly\nassignments.\nVocabulary building activities may be incorporated during certain times of the daily\nschedule or siblings may be tapped to assist with sorting and counting activities when\nappropriate.\nCONDUCTING MORE INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS DYSLEXIA THERAPY\nIf possible, therapists should send home a copy of the card decks students use during dyslexia\ntherapy so that parents can continue to review them with students. Districts should also send\nhome packets of oral language skills, phonological awareness skills, and letter tiles for them to\nwork on their alphabetizing skills. The goal is to offer supports that parents can provide to their\nstudents while they are at home. It is not recommended that they introduce new skills, but\nrather review the previously taught skills. Therapists may also provide recordings of themselves\nto show parents how to practice certain skills with their children.\nCONDUCTING TEACHER SUPPORT TEAM MEETINGS\nWhether or not a meeting is conducted will be determined by the number of weeks the\nschool/district is closed as well as the time of year. For example, if a school is closed for 3-5\nweeks, meetings may be suspended until faculty and staff return. However, in a situation such\nas an extended closure in which students will not return for the remainder of the school year, it\nis recommended that districts hold virtual end-of-year meetings to review data and create end-\nof-year notes to be used when making decisions regarding student placement for the fall.\nWhen school resumes, meetings will be held to make decisions regarding Tier placement,\nutilizing available data in the decision-making process.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n58\nDIFFERENTIATING ONLINE RESOURCES FOR ALL STUDENTS AND\nSTUDENTS RECEIVING INTERVENTION SUPPORTS\nIt is essential that specific deficit areas are on the student’s dashboard/assignment list for Tier II\nand Tier III. Documentation for how the student is progressing in those deficit areas should be\nprovided through the resource.\nENSURING ACCESS TO INTERVENTIONS\nSupport should be given to students through paper printouts, specifically related to the deficit\narea, if they do not have access to the online intervention. Determine if the district has a\ntechnology “check out” policy for devices or hotspots that can be utilized by students during\ndistance learning.\nPROVIDING RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS RECEIVEING INTERVENTIONS\nConsider sending home typical manipulatives used by students such as counters, geoboards or\nother math materials. These types of materials might also be in the form of materials made by\nthe school (e.g., counters made from construction paper cut into pieces). Additional resources\nmight include decodable or leveled readers.\nUSING DATA TO DOCUMENT STUDENT GROWTH\nAcceptable data may include information such as reports from online interventions, collected\nand scored paper/pencil assignments specific to deficit areas, and/or student performance on\nvirtual face-to-face assessments. These data points can be used for documenting student growth\nand decision making while students are out of school.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n59\nSECTION 18\nGlossary of Terms\nAccommodations help a student overcome or work around deficits affecting their ability to\nmaster the curriculum. Accommodations do not reduce learning expectations; they provide\naccess. Accommodations change the way a student accesses learning without changing the\nactual standards a student is working toward.\nAntecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) data is collected in an effort to identify the function of\na behavior. Antecedent reference to the events, action, or circumstances that occur before a\nbehavior. Behavior is the behavior that a student exhibits, and Consequences is the action or\nresponse that follows the behavior.\nBaseline data is the data that is collected before an intervention or program change begins.\nBehavior Intervention Plan (BIP) is a plan designed to teach and reinforce positive behaviors. This\ncan help prevent or stop problem behaviors in school. The BIP describes the problem behavior\nin observable and measurable terms, the reasons the behavior occurs and the intervention\nstrategies that will address the problem behavior.\nBehavioral Support Plan (BSP) is developed and implemented by a collaborative team, which\nincludes the student and the parent. The plan includes Positive Behavioral Interventions and\nSupports (PBIS), identified skills for school success, and specific strategies for behavioral\ninstruction. Best practice is for a team to use a functional behavioral assessment (FBA) to create\nthe plan.\nBenchmark Assessment is an assessment administered periodically throughout the school year\nat specified times during a curriculum sequence to evaluate students’ knowledge and skills\nrelative to an explicit set of longer-term learning goals. The design and choice of benchmark\nassessments are driven by the purpose, intended users, and uses of the instruments. Benchmark\nassessments can inform policy, instructional planning, and decision making at the classroom,\nschool, and/or district levels.\nChild Find is the ongoing process to identify, locate, and evaluate all children suspected of\nhaving disabilities who need special education and related services as a result of those\ndisabilities.\nComprehensive Assessment System is a coordinated system of multiple assessments, each of\nwhich is valid and reliable for its specified purpose and for the population with which it will be\nused. The system organizes information about the process and context of children's learning and\ndevelopment and provides a comprehensive and multifaceted picture of students’ academic\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n60\nand/or behavioral knowledge, abilities, and dispositions in order to help educators make\ninformed instructional and programmatic decisions at different times in the learning process.\nCriterion-Referenced Assessment is an approach to measure student performance in relation to\na specific standard. It typically is used to identify a student’s strengths and weaknesses in\nrelation to an age-group or grade-level standard; however, it does not compare students to\nother students.\nCulturally Responsive refers to the importance of including students’ cultural references in all\naspects of learning.\nCurriculum-Based Assessment (CBA) is an assessment that has three components: (1)\nmeasurement materials that are aligned with the annual curriculum, (2) measurement that\noccurs frequently, and (3) assessment data that are used to formulate instructional decisions.\nCBA is an umbrella term that includes curriculum-based measurement.\nCurriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) is an approach used to screen students or to monitor\nstudent progress in mathematics, reading, writing, spelling, and other content areas. CBM is a\ndistinctive form of curriculum-based assessment because of three additional properties: (1) Each\nCBM test is an alternate form of equivalent difficulty; (2) CBM measures are overall indicators\nof competence in the target curriculum; and (3) CBM is standardized, with its reliability and\nvalidity well documented. These properties allow teachers and schools to look at student growth\nover time.\nData-Based Problem Solving and Decision Making A process used by stakeholder teams from\nmultiple settings to analyze and evaluate information related to planning and\nimplementing effective instructional and/or intervention strategies matched to student\nneed.\nDevelopmentally Appropriate describes any activity involving children that is based on\nknowledge of the age and stages of child development, while understanding that each child\nis unique.\nDiagnostic Assessment is used to diagnose strengths and areas of need in students. Diagnostic\nassessment involves gathering and carefully evaluating detailed data involving students’\nknowledge and skills in a given learning area.\nDifferentiated Instruction is the way in which a teacher anticipates and responds to a variety of\nstudent needs in the classroom. To meet student needs, teachers differentiate by modifying the\ncontent (what is being taught), the process (how it is taught) and the product (how students\ndemonstrate their learning).\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n61\nDuration for the purposes of documenting response to intervention, refers to the length (number\nof minutes) of a session multiplied by the number of sessions per school year. \"Sufficient\nduration\" is dependent on a number of factors including the program or strategy being used, the\nage of the student, and the severity of the deficit involved. Some programs offer guidelines or\nrecommendations for duration and may even limit the number sessions in which a child can\nparticipate, believing that a child who does not make adequate gains after the specified amount\nof time would likely benefit from an alternative intervention.\nEvidence-Based refers to scientific, research-based methods that exhibit substantial evidence of\neffectiveness through multiple outcome evaluations. In other words, programs, strategies, and\nassessments shown to have had positive outcomes with a given population.\nExplicit Instruction is a structured, systematic approach by which to deliver instruction. Explicit\nInstruction is characterized by a series of supports or scaffolds, whereby students are guided\nthrough the learning process with clear statements about the purpose and rationale for the\nlearning, clear explanations and procedures in small steps, checking for student\nunderstanding, and achieving active and successful participation by all students.\nFidelity of Implementation refers to the application of an intervention, program, or curriculum\naccording to research findings and/or to a developer’s specifications.\nFormative Assessment is a process used by teachers and students during instruction that\nprovides feedback to adjust ongoing teaching and learning to improve students’ achievements of\nintended instructional outcomes. (CCSSO, FAST, SCASS, 2007)\nFunctional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) is the process used to identify problem behavior,\ndetermine the function or purpose of the behavior, and develop interventions to teach\nacceptable alternatives for the behavior.\nGap Analysis is a method for measuring the difference between the student's current level of\nperformance and benchmark expectations.\nGifted Student is a student who demonstrates a high degree of intellectual and/or creative\nability(ies), exhibits an exceptionally high degree of motivation, and/or excels in specific\nacademic fields, and who needs special instruction and/or special ancillary services to achieve at\nlevels commensurate with his or her abilities.\nGoal Line (also known as the aim line), represents the expected rate of student progress\nover time. A goal line is constructed by connecting the data point representing the student’s\ninitial performance level and the data point corresponding to the student’s year-end goal.\nThe goal line should be compared to the trend line to help inform responsiveness to intervention\nand to tailor a student’s instructional program.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n62\nIndividual Reading Plan (IRP) A personalized reading plan created for any student (K-3) who, at\nany time, exhibits a substantial deficiency in reading, as well as students who were promoted to\n4th grade with a good cause exemption.\nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) is a written document that is developed, reviewed, and\nrevised in accordance with IDEA 2004 that outlines the special education and related services\nspecifically designed to meet the unique educational needs of a student with a disability.\nInformal Diagnostic Assessment refers to data that may be used to identify a student’s specific\nskill deficits and strengths. These data may be derived from standardized measures, error\nanalysis of progress monitoring data, student work samples, and behavior rating forms, among\nother tools. Use of informal diagnostic assessments should allow teachers to identify a student’s\nspecific area(s) of difficulty when lack of progress is evident. This assessment will also inform\ndecisions about how to adapt individualized interventions for students.\nIntensive Interventions are academic and/or behavioral interventions characterized by increased\nlength, frequency, and duration of implementation for students who struggle significantly; often\nassociated with the narrowest tier of an RTI tiered model; also referred to as Tier III\ninterventions.\nIntervention is the systematic and explicit instruction provided to accelerate growth in an area of\nidentified need. Interventions are provided by general education teachers, reading\ninterventionists, trained paraprofessionals or the special education teachers. This instruction is\ndesigned to improve performance relative to specific, measurable goals. Interventions are based\non valid information about current performance, realistic implementation and include ongoing\nstudent progress monitoring data.\nLearning Disability is defined by IDEA 2004 in the following manner: The child does not achieve\nadequately for the child’s age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of\nthe following areas, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for\nthe child’s age or State-approved grade-level standards.\nLiteracy Based Promotion Act (LBPA) focuses on raising standards to improve reading skills of\nkindergarten through third-grade (K–3) students and to ensure that third-grade students are\nproficient in reading.\nModification is an adaptation to instruction or the administration of an assessment that change,\nlower, or reduce performance expectations for demonstration of a learning outcome.\nMultidisciplinary Evaluation Team (MET) is responsible for convening to review documentation,\ndetermining if a comprehensive evaluation for special education eligibility is necessary, and\nfulfilling other evaluation/child find responsibilities within fourteen (14) days of a parent or\npublic agency’s request for a comprehensive evaluation.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n63\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a framework for effective team-based problem solving\nthat is data informed, evidence-based, and flexible enough to meet the academic and behavioral\nneeds of all students.\nNorm-Referenced Assessment compares a student’s performance to that of an appropriate peer\ngroup or normative sample.\nPositive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) is an implementation framework that is\ndesigned to enhance academic and social behavior outcomes for all students by emphasizing the\nuse of data for informing decisions about the selection, implementation, and progress\nmonitoring of evidence-based behavioral practices.\nProblem Solving is the recursive, self-correcting, systematic process of finding solutions by\naccurately identifying problems, analyzing relevant data to understand why a problem is\noccurring, designing and implementing probable solutions, and measuring the effectiveness of\nthe solutions that were implemented.\nProgress Monitoring (PM) is the scientifically based practice used to assess students’ academic\nperformance and evaluate the effectiveness of instruction. Progress monitoring can be\nimplemented with individual students or an entire class. Also, the process used to monitor the\nimplementation of specific interventions.\nRate of Progress is a student’s progress toward grade-level achievement goals. Rate of learning\nis determined by reviewing assessment data as plotted on graphs.\nRemediation is instruction intended to remedy a situation; to teach a student something that he\nor she should have previously learned or be able to demonstrate; assumes appropriate strategies\nmatched to student learning have been used previously.\nResponse to Intervention (RTI) is the practice of providing high-quality instruction and\ninterventions matched to student need, monitoring progress frequently to make changes in\ninstruction or goals and applying child response data to important educational decisions. Also,\nResponse to Instruction / Responsiveness to Intervention.\nScaffolding is the systematic sequencing of prompted content, materials, tasks, and teacher and\npeer support to optimize learning. Students are given support until they can apply new skills and\nstrategies independently.\nScreening see Universal Screening.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n64\nSocial and Emotional Learning (SEL) is the process through which children and adults\nunderstand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for\nothers, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible relationships.\nSpecific Learning Disability (SLD) is a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological\nprocesses involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest\nitself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell or to do mathematical\ncalculations, including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, brain injury, minimal brain\ndysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. Specific Learning Disability does not include\nlearning problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities, of\nintellectual disability, of emotional disability or of environmental, cultural differences, or\neconomic disadvantage.\nSummative Assessments are tests administered after the conclusion of instruction to provide\ninformation regarding the level of student, school, or program success.\nSustainability is the ability of a leadership team to persistently and skillfully maintain its core\nbeliefs and values and use them to guide program adaptations to changes and pressures over\ntime.\nSystematic Instruction During this carefully planned and sequenced instruction the teacher\npresents lessons that build on one another, moving from simple to more complex. Skills are\nbroken down into smaller more manageable chunks, a method called task analysis. Temporary\ninstructional supports may be provided such as manipulatives, written prompts or cues.\nTeacher Support Team (TST) is the problem-solving unit responsible for interventions developed\nat Tier 3.\nTrend Line is a line on a graph that presents the line of best fit drawn through a series of data\npoints. The trend line can be compared against the aim line to help inform responsiveness to\nintervention and to tailor a student’s instructional program.\nUniversal Design for Learning is a framework to improve and optimize teaching and learning for\nall people based on scientific insights into how humans learn.\nUniversal Screening (academic) is a systematic process for assessment of all students within a\ngiven grade, school building or district on critical academic skills. These screenings are typically\nbrief assessments, or inventories, focused on target skills that are highly predictive of future\noutcomes.\nUniversal Screening (behavior) refers to the informal inventories of behaviors (internalizing and\nexternalizing) to indicate if students need additional support in specific behavior skills.\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION

The Mississippi Department Education (MDE) shall require every\nschool district to follow the instructional model, which consists of three (3) tiers\nof instruction:\na.\nTier 1: Quality classroom instruction based on Mississippi Curriculum\nFrameworks\nb.\nTier 2: Focused supplemental instruction\nc.\nTier 3: Intensive interventions specifically designed to meet the individual\n needs of students\n2.\nIf strategies at Tier 1 and Tier 2 are unsuccessful, students must be referred to the\nTeacher Support Team (TST). The TST is the problem-solving unit responsible for\ninterventions developed at Tier 3. Each school must have a Teacher Support Team\n(TST) implemented in accordance with the process developed by the MDE. The\nchairperson of the TST shall be the school principal as the school's instructional\nleader or the principal's designee. The designee may not be an individual whose\nprimary responsibility is special education. Interventions will be:\na.\ndesigned to address the deficit areas;\nb.\nevidence based;\nc.\nimplemented as designed by the TST;\nd.\nsupported by data regarding the effectiveness of interventions.\n3.\nTeachers should use progress monitoring information to:\na.\ndetermine if students are making adequate progress,\nb.\nidentify students as soon as they begin to fall behind, and\nc.\nmodify instruction early enough to ensure each student gains essential skills.\nMonitoring of student progress is an ongoing process that may be measured\nthrough informal classroom assessment, benchmark assessment instruments,\nand large-scale assessments.\nAPPENDIX A\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\n72\n4.\nAfter a referral is made, the TST must develop and begin implementation of an\nintervention(s) within two weeks. No later than eight weeks after implementation of\nthe intervention(s) the TST the intervention(s), a second review must be conducted to\ndetermine whether the intervention(s) is successful. If the intervention(s) is\ndetermined to be unsuccessful, then the student will be referred for a comprehensive\nassessment.\n5.\nIn accordance with the Literacy-Based Promotion Act of 2013, each public-\nschool student who exhibits a substantial deficiency in reading at any time,\nas demonstrated through:\na.\nperformance on a reading screener approved or developed by the MDE, or\nb.\nlocally determined assessments and teacher observations\nconducted in Kindergarten and Grades 1 through 3, or\nc.\nstatewide end-of-year assessments or approved alternate yearly assessments\nin Grade 3, must be given intensive reading instruction and intervention\nimmediately following the identification of the reading deficiency. A student\nwho was promoted from Grade 3 to Grade 4 under a good cause exemption of\nthe Literacy-Based Promotion Act must be given intensive reading instruction\nand intervention. The intensive intervention must include effective\ninstructional strategies and appropriate teaching methodologies necessary to\nassist the student in becoming a successful reader, able to read at or above\ngrade level, and ready for promotion to the next grade.\n6.\nA dyslexia screener must be administered to all students during the spring of\ntheir kindergarten year and the fall of their first-grade year. The screening\nmust include the following components:\na.\nPhonological awareness and phonemic awareness;\nb.\nSound symbol recognition;\nc.\nAlphabet knowledge;\nd.\nDecoding skills;\ne.\nEncoding skills; and\nf.\nRapid naming (quickly naming objects, pictures, colors, or symbols\n(letters or digits) aloud.\n7.\nAll students in Kindergarten and grades 1 through 3 shall be administered a state-\napproved screener within the first 30 days of school and repeated at mid-year and at\nthe end of the school year, to identify any deficiencies in reading. EXCEPTION:\nStudents in grade 3 who are not identified for intervention on mid-year\nscreeners are not required to be screened again at the end of the school\nyear.

Learning\nincludes\nmastering\nacademic\nstandards,\nundergoing\nsocial-emotional\ndevelopment\nand\napplying knowledge and skills in new\nsituations.\nWe\ncontinuously\nfocus\non\nproviding\nhigh-quality instruction from pre-\nkindergarten through adult.\nThis\nis\naccomplished\nthrough\neffective, differentiated and culturally responsive\nclassroom instruction,\ncomplemented\nwith\npositive\nand\nsuccessful\nclassroom\nmanagement,\ndelivered\nby highly qualified\nteachers who have administrators, instructional\nand related services support staff and\nother\nconsultants\navailable\nto\nsupport programs\nand processes. All of this ensures all students’\nneeds\nare\nmet\nalong\ntheir\npersonalized\neducational pathways toward college, career\nand life readiness.\nUltimately, the role of the education system is\nto prepare every student for life with a focus\non college and career readiness. To this end, it is\nthe position of the Florida Department of\nEducation that a multi-tiered system of supports\nrepresents a logic and set of core beliefs,\nincluding\nthe systematic use of a problem-\nsolving\nprocess\nthat\nmust\nbe\nintegrated\nseamlessly\ninto\neducational\ninitiatives\nthroughout Florida.\nThe reality is that not all students are successful in\neffective classrooms. Indeed, some students\ncome to school at risk for poor learning\nexperiences and outcomes, while others are\nstruggling\nlearners\nwho\nare\ndisengaged,\nunmotivated,\nunresponsive, underperforming or\nconsistently unsuccessful. For these students, we\nare required to have multi-tiered\nservices,\nsupports,\nstrategies,\nprograms, interventions\nand\nsystems\nto\naddress\ntheir individual\nacademic or behavioral needs.\nBroward County Public Schools is committed\nto educating all students for success. One key\ntactic to meeting our goals is a Multi-Tiered\nSystem of Supports. MTSS is a framework for\nimplementing\nsystemic,\nevidence-based\npractices to maximize student achievement in\nacademics and behavior in preparation for and\nleading to college career and life readiness.\nPage | 4\nAcknowledgments\nBroward County Public Schools\n▪\nStudent Support Initiatives &Recovery\nDivision\n▪\nSchool Climate & Discipline Department\n▪\nDistrict Multi-Tiered System of Supports\nInstructional Facilitators\n▪\nMulti-Tiered System of Supports District\nLeadership Team\n▪\nExceptional Student Learning Support\nDivision\n▪\nLiteracy Department\n▪\nBilingual/ESOL\n▪\nElementary Learning Department\n▪\nSecondary Learning Department\n▪\nOffice of School Performance &\nAccountability\n▪\nReimagining Middle Grades Team\n▪\nFlorida Problem Solving/Response to\nIntervention (PS/RtI) Project Team\n▪\nFlorida Inclusion Network Facilitators\nVision\nEducating today’s students to succeed in\ntomorrow’s world.\nMission\nEducating all students to reach their highest\npotential.\nPurpose\nThis document provides schools with a\nfoundational understanding of a Multi-\nTiered System of Supports (MTSS).

Built upon a broad research base,\nvarious RtI models with the following common features have been developed:\n1. multiple tiers of intervention service delivery,\n2. a problem-solving process, and\n3. the use of data collection/assessment to inform decisions at each tier of service\ndelivery (National Association of State Directors of Special Education, 2006)\nIDEA 2004 also recognized positive behavior support as an evidence-based practice and\nallowable use for funding to provide prevention and intervention for students with\ndisabilities. Since 2004, Florida has engaged in continuous efforts to make sense of how\nsystematic problem-solving and the RtI framework integrate the various elements of\nFlorida’s system of education.\nOver time, as districts and schools became more fluent with the implementation of both\nRtI and PBIS practices, the similarities of the two frameworks/systems became apparent.\nTherefore,\nFlorida\nadopted\nthe\nMulti-Tiered\nSystem\nof\nSupports\n(MTSS)\nconceptual framework as a representation of two sustainable systems change\nframeworks: Response to Intervention (RtI) and Positive Behavioral Interventions and\nSupports (PBIS).\nTo better articulate a focus on equitable and efficient learning environments and high-\nquality instructional practices, usage of the term MTSS emerged. Research and\nlessons learned from schools and districts contributed to the shift to a Multi-Tiered\nSystem of Supports (MTSS) as the best description of a continuum of effective\nacademic and behavioral and social-emotional instruction and supports for every\nstudent.\nEvery\nStudent\nSucceeds\nAct\nof\n2015,\nreauthorizes\nthe\nElementary\nand\nSecondary Education Act, suggests that LEAs develop and implement tiered\nintervention programs. According to ESSA, the term \"multi-tier system of supports\"\nmeans \"a comprehensive continuum of evidence-based, systemic practices to\nsupport a rapid response to students' needs, with regular observation to facilitate\ndata-based instructional decision making for both behavior and academic needs.\nThis document addresses the transition from RtI and/or PBIS implementation to\nthe development of a MTSS framework.\nPage | 6\nWhat is Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS)?\nA Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a seamless prevention framework that\nintegrates all students. It is a term used to describe an evidence-based model of\nschooling that uses data-based problem solving to integrate standards-based\ninstruction, interventions and assessments to address the full range of student\nacademic and behavioral needs present in today’s classroom.\nMTSS, Response to Instruction and Intervention (RtI), and Positive Behavioral Interventions\nand Supports (PBIS) are often spoken of synonymously, and for those new to MTSS, it can\nbe difficult to determine what people mean when these terms are used interchangeably.\nIt is important to keep in mind, though, that MTSS is a framework for aligning resources\nand initiatives; it is a method of organization. As such, MTSS encompasses both RtI and\nPBIS, and systematically addresses support for all students.\nMTSS encompasses all the academic, behavioral and social-emotional demands of\nlearning. MTSS is a key part of the broader BCPS strategic framework to support all learners\nand ensure equitable access to a robust, high quality education. MTSS provides the\nstructure for the District to prioritize the academic and behavioral needs of all students,\nincluding our Students with Disabilities (SWDs), students with advanced learning needs\nand English Language Learners (ELL).\nIn Broward County Public Schools (BCPS), MTSS promotes a well-integrated system, where\nthe needs of all learners are identified and supported early through increasing levels of\ninstructional intensity and time. MTSS involves the application of implementation science\nand the integration of a student support framework into one coherent system. MTSS\nprovides high-quality, standards-based instruction and intervention that is matched\nto students’ academic, behavioral and social needs to maximize the impact on\nstudent outcomes.\nMulti-Tiered\nSystem\nof\nSupports\n(MTSS)\nrefers\nto\nall\nthe\ninstructional\nstrategies, interventions and other resources that are used to help all students achieve.\nAn effective system blends culturally responsive academic and behavior supports to\ncreate effective environments that address a range of student needs.\nPage | 7\nWhy is Multi-Tiered System of Supports important?\nThe Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) framework is built for success. It encompasses\nthe tools educators need for continuous improvement, problem-solving and decision-\nmaking. It provides schools with meaningful data to positively impact students and their\nfamilies, setting them on a path for success. MTSS is built on the idea of intervening early\nto prevent failure and to maximize the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction. It is not\nan initiative or program, but rather a framework for providing high quality curriculum and\ninstruction to all students and intervention support for some students.\nThe basic elements of a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) are required by Every\nStudent Succeeds Act (ESSA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA\n2004). According to Florida Administrative Code: 6A-6.0331 General Education\nIntervention Procedures, Evaluation, Determination of Eligibility, Reevaluation and the\nProvision of Exceptional Student Education Services, “It is the local school\ndistrict’s responsibility to develop and implement a multi-tiered system of supports\nwhich integrates a continuum of academic and behavioral interventions for students\nwho need additional support to succeed in the general education environment.”\nThe goal of MTSS in Broward County Public Schools is to provide an integrated, pre-\nschool through college and career ready, district-wide system of supports in order to\nimprove academic achievement, positive behavior and strong social emotional\nlearning for every student.\nEffective implementation of MTSS is associated with an increased likelihood of instruction\nand interventions leading to successful student outcomes. Implementing MTSS\nwill contribute\nto\nmore\nmeaningful\nearlier\nidentification\nof\nlearning\nand\nbehavioral\nproblems,\nand\nimprovement\nof\ninstructional\nquality.\nHigh-quality\nimplementation of MTSS provides all students with the best opportunities to succeed in\nschool and assist with the earlier identification of students with disabilities. In summary,\nMTSS will benefit all students in that it will provide a framework for more personalized\ninstruction and need-based interventions and supports.\nIn other words, MTSS is enacted across every “ed” in our school district. Broward County\nPublic Schools has made an intentional shift in terminology to a “multi-tiered system of\nsupports” to emphasize the integration of both academics and behavior as uniformly\ncritical to student success. MTSS implementation is a shared responsibility and\nownership of all BCPS educators, staff, families and communities.\nPage | 8\nWho Should Receive MTSS?\nThe Florida Department of Education views a MTSS as an avenue to work\ncollaboratively to significantly improve the way in which the needs of all students\nenrolled in Florida schools are addressed. In this way, students at all points on the\ncontinuum of education receive effective interventions and support.\nAll students are participants in the MTSS process. Not only does MTSS provide a structured\nand thoughtful application of interventions and supports for students who are not\nmeeting expectations, it also provides a balanced approach to providing enriching\nactivities for those who do. MTSS provides the structure and framework to provide\ninterventions for students who need help, and, when necessary, document interventions\nfor students who might be considered for special education services.\nMTSS provides the framework for teaching standards, providing focused instruction and\nintervention, ensuring that all students are learning and maximizing their potential. MTSS\nacts as a way of organizing supports within a school and district so that both the\nacademic side and the behavior, social-emotional-learning side are aligned to serve the\nwhole child.\nSo, while RtI focuses on academics and PBIS focuses on behavior and social and\nemotional learning, MTSS encompasses them all to ensure successful education\noutcomes for all students by using a data-based problem solving process to provide,\nand evaluate, the effectiveness of multiple tiers of integrated academic, behavior and\nsocial-emotional instruction, interventions and supports along a continuum reflecting\nthe need\nfor all students to have fluid access to instruction and supports of varying intensity levels.\nPage | 9\nEssential Components of MTSS\nThe essential components of MTSS together creates a system of supports for all learners. The\ncomponents represent the integration of existing evidenced-based educational reform initiatives,\nResponse to Intervention (RtI) and Positive\nBehavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS).\nThe critical components of an effective MTSS\nimplementation include:\n▪\nLeadership\n▪\nBuilding the Capacity and Infrastructure\nfor implementation\n▪\nCommunication and Collaboration\n▪\nData-Based Problem-Solving Process\n▪\nThree-Tiered Instructional and\nIntervention model\n▪\nData Evaluation\nLeadership\nLeadership is key to successful implementation of any large-scale innovation. The principal\nand collaborative problem-solving Team (CPST) are critical to implementing a MTSS at the school\nlevel. The CPST is a multi-disciplinary team of professionals who create and support a structure for\nschool-based decision making, establish and monitor school-wide learning and development\ngoals, ensure and coordinate the delivery of services to all students (academic, behavior,\nsocial-emotional learning), allocate the resources needed to fully implement plans with fidelity,\nand monitor the effectiveness of Universal (Tier 1), Targeted (Tier 2) and Intensive (Tier 3)\ninstruction, intervention and support.\nPage | 10\nMembers of the Collaborative Problem-Solving Team (CPS Team)\n▪\nPrincipal/Principal Designee\n▪\nMTSS Contact\n▪\nGrade Level/Department Chairs\n▪\nInstructional Coach(es)\n▪\nStudents\n▪\nBehavioral Specialist\n▪\nParents and Guardians\n▪\nGuidance Director/School\nCounselor(s)\n▪\nSpeech Language Pathologist\n▪\nESE Specialist\n▪\nESOL Contact\n▪\nSchool-based Liaisons (Equity, SEL)\n▪\nPsychologist\n▪\nCommunity Liaison\n▪\nSocial Worker\n▪\nFamily Counselor\n▪\nDistrict Support Staff (MTSS)\n▪\nOutside Agencies\n▪\nTeacher/Interventionist\nParticipation determined by meeting content\nResponsibilities of the CPST include:\n▪\nensuring that the critical elements of MTSS are defined and understood by school\nstaff, including curriculum, assessment and instructional practices\n▪\nactively engaging staff in ongoing professional development and coaching to\nsupport MTSS implementation\n▪\nactively facilitating implementation of MTSS as part of their school improvement\nplanning process\n▪\nFrequently (minimum bi-weekly meetings) lead CPS Team in problem solving and\ndata driven decision making processes\nBuilding the Capacity and Infrastructure for Implementation\nBuilding the capacity to implement MTSS is crucial to being able to sustain the use of\nproblem-solving and data-based decision making. Important factors in capacity\nbuilding includes involving key people and leaders; building the school culture to support\nthe practice; working to infuse problem-solving and data-based decision making into\nongoing\nstructures\nsuch\nas\nfaculty\nmeetings,\ngrade\nand\ncontent\narea\nmeetings, curriculum committees and PLCs; and making use of student data to inform\nactions and expectations for all staff. The District Multi-Tier System of Supports (D-MTSS)\nstaff focus on building critical infrastructure and sustainable systems at the District and\nschool levels.\nPage | 11\nThe District MTSS Team supports schools in building effective leadership and\ncoaching school teams to be able to implement and sustain MTSS practices with\nfidelity.\nThe CPS Team facilitates professional development and provides coaching for all\nstaff members (relative to their job roles and responsibilities) on:\n▪\nassessments and data sources used to inform decisions\n▪\ndata literacy and data-based problem solving\n▪\nmulti-tiered instruction and intervention\nThe role of the school based MTSS contact (may be identified as a facilitator, staff\ndeveloper or team leader) is to provide technical assistance and support to school\nstaff to improve implementation of the components of a Multi-Tiered System of\nSupports model. Responsibilities may include:\n▪\nmodeling and supporting data literacy\n▪\nfacilitating collaborative problem-solving processes\n▪\nproviding leadership for sustainability of systems\n▪\ndemonstrating leadership in instructional improvement\n▪\nproviding assistance and professional growth opportunities to teachers\nCommunication and Collaboration\nOngoing communication and collaboration are essential for successful implementation\nof MTSS. Many innovations fail due to a lack of consensus, to a lack of feedback to\nimplementers in order to promote continuous improvement, and to not involving\nstakeholders in planning. In addition to including stakeholders, it is also important to build\nthe infrastructure to communicate and work with families and other community partners.\nThere practices increase the likelihood that innovative practices will be implemented\nand sustained.\n Data Based Problem-Solving\nThe use of data-based problem solving to make educational decisions is another critical\ncomponent of MTSS implementation. Problem solving is the practice of providing high-\nquality instruction and intervention matched to student needs and using learning rate\nover time and level of performance to make important educational decisions (Batsche,\net al., 2005).\nData-based problem-solving means that data are used effectively to improve learning\nand informs how patterns of student performance across diverse groups (e.g.,\nracial/ethnic, cultural, socio-economic, language proficiency, disability status) are\naddressed.\nPage | 12\nData Based Decision Making is an integral part of the teaming process. Teams should\nuse data and decision rules to determine effectiveness of the Universal (Tier 1) program,\nidentify students in need of interventions and evaluate student progress to determine\nnext steps. Integrated data-based problem solving for student academic, behavior\nand social-emotional outcomes occurs across content areas, grade levels and tiers.\nAcross all tiers, data is used to identify the difference or “gap” between expected\noutcomes and current student performance relative to academic, behavior and\nsocial-emotional goals.\nAt all levels and in all settings, the problem-solving process incorporates at least the\nfollowing four steps in a cyclical, recurring model to address prevention,\nearly intervention and intensive intervention:\nStep 1. Define: Problem Identification\nWhat is the problem? How does the group’s/student’s performance compare to\nbenchmark level of performance and peers’ level of performance?\nStep 2. Analyze:\nProblem Analysis\nWhy is the problem\noccurring? What would\nhappen if _____ would\noccur? Can we validate our\nideas?\nStep 3. Implement:\nIntervention Design\nWhat are we going to do\nabout the problem? What\nwill we teach? How will we\nteach it? Is instruction\nmatched to the problem we\nidentified?\nStep 4. Evaluate:\nResponse to Intervention\n(RtI)\nIs the instruction and\nintervention working?\nHow do we know? Is\nacademic and/or behavior\nperformance improved? Are outcomes for all students equitable? Is the\ngroup’s/student’s response good, questionable or poor? What are the next steps?\nPage | 13\nThree-Tiered Instructional and Intervention Model\nA three-tiered instruction and intervention framework is used to organize resources and\nsupports to ensure student learning and educational success. The intensity of supports\nprovided to students matches student need.\nTiers of instruction:\n▪\nare provided per each student’s need\n▪\nensure that each student may master grade and age appropriate standards\nand expectations\n▪\nensure that each student may progress successfully (on time, age\nappropriately) through the PK-12 system\nALL students receive instruction and intervention within a tiered system:\nTier 1: Universal Instruction and Supports for ALL Students - The general academic and\nbehavior instruction and support designed and differentiated for all students in all settings\nto support the full continuum of student needs.\n▪\nView video: MTSS: Universal Support\nTier 2: Targeted Interventions and Supports for Some Students - The academic and\nbehavioral instruction and intervention that is provided to students who show a need for\nhelp in addition to the instruction and support they receive at Tier 1.\no\nView video: MTSS: Additional Support\nTier 3: Intensive Individualized Interventions and Supports for a Few Students - The\nacademic and behavioral instruction and intervention that is provided to students who\nshow a need for intensive and individualized support that is provided in addition to\nUniversal (Tier 1) and as determined may need Targeted (Tier 2) instruction and\nintervention.\no\nView video: MTSS: Intensified Support\nThe effectiveness of each tier of instruction must be regularly monitored to ensure the\nstrength of the entire system. The problem-solving process is a recursive, self-correcting,\nongoing methodology used for effective decision making at all levels within the system.\nPage | 14\nData Evaluation\nThe CPS Team is responsible for ensuring that all staff understand the purpose\nof assessments and have access to academic, behavior and social-emotional\ndata sources that address the following purposes of assessment:\n▪\nidentify students at risk academically, behaviorally, socially and/or emotionally\n▪\ndetermine why a (any) student is at risk\n▪\nmonitor student academic, behavior and social-emotional growth and progress\n▪\ninform academic, behavior and social-emotional instructional and intervention\nplanning\n▪\ndetermine student attainment of academic, behavior and social-emotional\noutcomes\nPolicies and procedures for decision-making are established that include schedules for\nscreening, the use of diagnostic assessments, frequent progress monitoring, and the\ncriteria for determining tiers of support needed. Staff also administer assessments, access\ndata sources and make data-based decisions with fidelity to the policies and procedures\nestablished by the leadership team.\nThe CPS Team periodically conducts analyses to determine how implementation of\ncritical elements of MTSS relate to positive student outcomes; that is, resources are\nallocated based on student need, the relationship between the resources allocated and\nthe outcomes of students is evaluated, and processes and criteria for resource allocation\nare refined based on strategies that result in improved student outcomes. It is also vital\nthat the CPS Team frequently evaluate how MTSS is implemented, providing information\non what practices relate to improvements in student academic, behavioral and social-\nemotional outcomes.\n(Sources: PCS MTSS Implementation Guide, Self-Assessment of MTSS Implementation and Florida Department of\nEducation’s Multi-Tiered System of Supports)\nPage | 15\nWhat is Response to Intervention?\nAt the core of implementing a MTSS framework is the systematic use of a data-based\nproblem solving and decision-making process that must be integrated seamlessly into\nall systems planning, including school improvement plans, student progression plans,\nK-12 comprehensive reading plans, differentiated accountability plans, Early Warning\nSystems (EWS) and leader and educator evaluation plans. This problem-solving process\napplied within the multi-tiered system must be applied to all learners, which includes\ngeneral education students from pre-k through graduation, students with disabilities, and\nadvanced and gifted learners in order to elevate the efficacy of statewide improvement\nefforts and processes.\nFlorida’s Statewide Response to Instruction and Intervention Implementation (RtI)\nPlan was disseminated in 2008 and is still accessible at Florida’s Multi-Tiered System of\nSupports website. The plan outlines a framework for statewide implementation of\nproblem solving and RtI through the establishment of an infrastructure that includes\ndistrict-based leadership teams (DBLT) implementing district-based\nplans\nto\nsupport school-based\nleadership\nteams\n(SBLT) implementing school-based plans.\nAs stated in Florida’s Statewide PS-RtI Plan (2008): “…all schools\nin\nFlorida\nshould\nensure\nevidence-based\npractices,\ninstructionally relevant assessments,\nsystematic\nproblem-\nsolving to meet all students’ needs, data-based decision\nmaking, effective professional\ndevelopment,\nsupportive leadership and meaningful student and parent\ninvolvement.\nResponse to Intervention (RtI) is a general education approach of\nhigh-quality instruction, early intervention and prevention and behavioral strategies\naligned within a Multi-Tiered System of Supports. RtI is defined as the practice of providing\n(1) high-quality instruction/intervention matched to student needs and (2) using learning\nrate over time and level of performance to (3) make important educational decisions.\nResponse to Intervention (RtI) integrates assessment and intervention within a multi‐level\nprevention system to maximize student achievement and reduce behavior problems.\nSchools use data to identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes, monitor student\nprogress, provide evidence‐based interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of\nthose interventions depending on a student’s responsiveness, and identify students with\nlearning disabilities or other disabilities. The essential components of a RtI framework are\nscreening, progress monitoring, multi-level or multi-tier prevention system and data-\nbased decision making. These are the foundation principles of an RtI framework.\nPage | 16\nRtI Implementation Statutory Requirements\n▪\nFS 1008.25(a) – Student Progression Plan Requirements for Intervention\n▪\nFS 1008.25(4)(a) Requirements for intervention when students do not score at the\nproficient level on the Florida Standards Assessment (FSA) or state-required end-\nof-course assessments (EOC); (b) Requirement for a progress monitoring plan for\nstudents not making adequate progress\n▪\nFS 1001.42 – Powers of the School Board requiring that schools address students\nwho have multiple ‘watch list’ criteria and provide interventions accordingly\nIn addition, IDEA and State Board Rule require that a student’s response to research-\nbased intensive intervention serve as the foundation for identification of certain learning\ndisabilities.\nRtI Framework and Essential Components\nBroward County Public Schools is committed to providing all children with the additional\nsupport and resources needed to be successful. Response to Intervention (RtI) is a\ngeneral education initiative and one form of support for helping students. It is one arm of\nthe Multi-Tiered System of Supports, which seeks to provide adequate and effective\nsupport to all students. RtI encompasses the foundational principles of research-\nbased effective instruction, ongoing progress monitoring and modification of instruction\nbased upon the progress monitoring data.\nResponse to Intervention (RtI) is a multi-level prevention system which includes three\nlevels of intensity or prevention designed to meet the academic, behavior and\nsocial emotional instructional needs of all children. Each level targets a specific\ngroup of learners, is supported by evidence-based instructional materials and\nprovides differentiated small-group instruction and routine progress monitoring.\nThe primary prevention level, Universal (Tier1), includes high quality core instruction.\nThe secondary level, Targeted (Tier 2), includes evidence-based intervention(s) of\nmoderate intensity.\nThe\ntertiary\nprevention\nlevel, Intensive\n(Tier\n3),\nincludes\nindividualized intervention(s)\nof\nincreased\nintensity\nfor\nstudents\nwho\nshow\nminimal response to instruction and intervention. Individually responsive supports are\ndeveloped based on individual need but may be provided in a small group or\nindividual format. Tier 2 and 3 supports are provided in addition to, not in place of,\nTier 1 instruction. At all levels, attention should be on fidelity of implementation, with\nconsideration for cultural and linguistic responsiveness and recognition of student\nstrengths.\nIt’s important to note that MTSS tiers may look quite different from school to school.\nMTSS focuses on the overall needs of individual students, and what may be a Tier 2\nintervention in one school might be a Tier 1 in another. It is up to each school to\ndevelop an MTSS framework that addresses challenges specific to that school’s\ncommunity.\nPage | 17\nRtI Three-Tiered Instruction and Intervention Model\nTier 1: Universal Instruction and Supports for ALL Students - The general academic and\nbehavior instruction and support designed and differentiated for all students in all settings\nto support the full continuum of student needs.\nUniversal (Tier 1) Instruction and Supports are:\n▪\nHigh quality teaching and supports for academics, behavior and social emotional\n▪\nImplementing well-researched programs and best practices\n▪\nDelivering integrated instruction and intervention that is designed to\nmeet the needs of all learners\n▪Providing structures and system for creating a positive school\n▪\nand classroom climate\nUniversal (Tier 1) instruction, also known as core instruction, the\ninstruction which all students must have universal access. It is the\nacademic and behavioral grade level instruction that each student receives daily. For\nmany students, Universal (Tier 1) instruction will meet their needs. For approximately 80 -\n85% of students Universal (Tier 1) instruction will meet their academic, behavior and social\nemotional needs and they will demonstrate proficiency and growth when good first\ninstruction is delivered.\nTier 2: Targeted Interventions and Supports for Some Students - The academic and\nbehavioral instruction and intervention that is provided to students who show a need for\nhelp in addition to the instruction and intervention they receive at Tier 1, in order to\nincrease student success in Tier 1. Targeted (Tier 2) instruction and intervention is more\nintensive than Universal (Tier 1). Increased intensity is defined as an increase in time, a\nnarrower focus, and a broader type of instruction.\nTargeted (Tier 2) Interventions and Supports are:\n▪\nAligning and integrating Targeted (Tier 2) interventions with Universal (Tier 1)\nacademic and behavioral instruction and supports\n▪\nSmaller groups of students who share the same instructional need\n▪\nEvidenced-based and culturally responsive teaching for the needs\nof the students\n▪\nProgress monitoring data are collected more frequently and\nmonitored bi-weekly\nTargeted (Tier 2) instruction is strategic instruction, at grade level,\nfor students who need additional support in learning grade level\nacademic or behavioral material. Tier 2 instruction is intended to be timely and\ncoordinated with Tier 1 instruction. Approximately 10 – 15% of students may need\nTargeted (Tier 2) instruction in the ideal MTSS framework. Tier 2 needs and interventions\nare identified during PLC conversations referencing the four critical PLC questions.\nUniversal\n(Tier 1)\nTargeted\n(Tier 2)\nPage | 18\nTier 3: Intensive Individualized Interventions and Supports for a Few Students - The\nacademic and behavioral instruction and intervention that is provided to students who\nshow a need for intensive and individualized help that is provided in addition to Universal\n(Tier 1) and as determined Targeted (Tier 2).\nIntensive (Tier 3) Interventions and Supports are:\n▪\nSignificantly increasing time and intensity on the most critical set of skills\n▪\nSignificantly smaller instructional group (1 – 3)\n▪\nIntegrating Intensive (Tier 3) interventions and supports with Universal (Tier 1)\ninstruction\n▪Using data to inform intensity and time while frequently monitoring progress\nat least weekly\n▪\nExtensive opportunities for guided practice\n▪\nMore systematic instructional sequencing and scaffolding\nIntensive (Tier 3) Instruction is intensive instruction and support provided\nto approximately 1 – 5% of the students who are struggling with significant learning gaps\nand need academic and/or behavioral support. Typically, these students do not have\nthe appropriate grade level skills yet to be successful in solely Tier 1. Intensive (Tier 3)\nprovides yet an additional level of intervention to help students develop foundational\nskills and the most critical set of academic and behavioral skills.\nThe diagram below illustrates RtI Three-Tiered Instruction and Intervention Model\nIntensive\n(Tier 3)\nPage | 19\nTier 1: Universal Instruction and Supports for ALL Students\nGroup Size\nFrequency and Duration\nType of Delivery\nTypes of Assessments\nGroup size\n▪All students\n(100%)\n▪Fluid and\nflexible\nFrequency\n▪\nDaily\nDuration\n▪\nELA 90 - 120\nminutes\n▪\nMath 60 minutes\n▪\nBehavior\nthroughout day\nProgress Monitoring\n▪\nThree times per\nyear\nResponsible Educator\n▪\nClassroom teacher\n▪\nContent specialist\nscreening team\nTypes of Delivery\n▪\nWhole group\n▪\nSmall group\n▪\nIndividualized\nlearning\nSetting\n▪\nGeneral education\nclassroom\nTypes of Assessments\n▪\nUniversal Screeners\n▪\nSummative\n▪\nFormative\n▪\nStandardized assessments\n▪\nFSA, BAS, FAIR, EOC\n▪\nCommon Assessments\n▪\ni-Ready/Achieve 3000\n▪\nOffice Discipline Referrals\n(ODR)\n▪\nSuspensions (Internal and\nExternal)\n▪\nEarly Warning Signs (EWS)\n▪\nAttendance\nProblem Solving\nImperative Questions at Universal (Tier 1) Instruction\nStep 1: Problem\nIdentification\nAre students provided with well-delivered, scientific, evidence-based core instruction?\nHow is this verified?\nWhat assessment tools or processes are used to identify instructional needs and the\nstudents’ response to instruction?\nIs the core instruction effective?\n▪\nWhat percent of students are achieving standards/benchmarks/behavioral\nexpectations (approximately 80% or more)?\n▪\nWhat percent of students in subgroups are achieving standards/\nbenchmarks/behavior? expectations (approximately 80% or more)?\nStep 2: Problem\nAnalysis\nIf the core instruction is not effective –\n▪\nIs the curriculum appropriately matched to the needs of at least 80% of the\nstudents?\n▪\nIs support provided for implementation fidelity?\nTo what extent is the school-based leadership team engaged in core level problem solving\nin order to increase the effectiveness of core instruction/behavioral supports?\nHow are parents and students involved or engaged in supporting effective core\ninstruction/behavioral supports?\nStep 3: Instructional\nDesign and\nImplementation\nWhat instructional strategies will be put into place to address any deficiencies or gaps in\nthe instruction?\nWhat is the decision rule to determine if a student(s) will require supplemental and more\nintensive, individualized intervention and support?\nStep 4:\nResponse to\nIntervention\nWhat does the student data show that indicates instructional practices met the needs of\nat least 80% of the students?\nPage | 20\nTier 2: Targeted Interventions and Supports for Some Students\nProblem Solving\nImperative Questions at Targeted Instruction (Tier 2)\nStep 1: Problem\nIdentification\nAre students provided with evidence-based targeted instruction?

The problem-\nsolving process is used to make data-based decisions in general education and\nall other education\nprogramming,\ncreating\na\nwell-integrated\nsystem\nof\ninstruction and intervention guided by student data.\nThis process is most effective when used by teams of educators with a variety of expertise\nto accelerate students’ educational performance, growth and engagement. Family and\ncommunity engagement is a critical element to ensure successful outcomes of the\nproblem-solving process.\nThe problem-solving process is a well-established method of identifying, implementing\nand evaluating educational solutions that are designed to improve student performance\nand growth. The process enables teams of educators at the district and school levels to\nensure instructional resources reach the right students and schools at the right levels to\naccelerate the performance and growth of every student to achieve and/or exceed\nproficiency with accepted academic, behavioral and social-emotional standards and\ngoals. Simply stated, teams of educators engage in this process to more effectively and\nefficiently educate and support all students. The four steps are:\nStep 1: Identify the desired goal\nStep 2: Analyze the cause or problem, determine “WHY” the goal is not being attained\nStep 3: Develop and Implement the intervention plan\nStep 4: Evaluate the response to intervention\nPage | 23\nThe problem-solving process is a self-corrective, decision-making model focused on\nacademic and/or behavioral intervention development and progress monitoring\nof student response to intervention. The problem-solving process is used to plan,\nevaluate and revise all tiers of instruction. The four-step problem solving process\nincludes a structured format that is used when analyzing possible reasons for the lack\nof progress for a student or group of students' academic achievement or\nbehavioral functioning. Utilizing\na\nstructured\nproblem-solving\napproach\nwhen\nexploring, identifying and prioritizing concerns helps teams make efficient use of time\nand increases the probability that appropriate interventions are selected.\nProblem-Solving Process - Step 1: Identify the Desired Goal\nDefine the Goal – Identification step consists of five (5) elements\nGoal Identification: identify the goal(s) that is the focus of the\nfour (4) step process. Academic goals should be aligned\nwith standards. Behavioral and social-emotional goals\nshould be aligned with the behaviors expected to engage\nin\nlearning\nand\nto\npromote\nsocial-emotional\ncompetency.\nDesired Level of Performance: Clearly identify the level at\nwhich the student(s) are expected to perform, based on the\nappropriate age, grade and developmental level standards.\nCurrent Level of Performance: Clearly identify the current level of performance on\nthe goal(s) demonstrated by the student(s). The data collected should be valid and\naccessible data that reflect accurately the goal.\nPeer Level of Performance: Clearly identify the current level of performance for\nappropriate peers. The peer comparison group could include peers of the same\nrace/ethnicity, gender, primary language, socio-economic status, grade and disability\nstatus. The purpose of using peer data for gap comparison is to identify for whom the four\n(4) step process is intended, identified student(s) and/or the entire peer group.\nGap Analysis: The gap is defined as the difference between the currently level of\nperformance and the desired level (amount of improvement to be attained), the\ndifference between the student(s) who are the target of the intervention and the\nappropriate peer group, to determine the appropriate target student(s) or group.\nWhat are the critical outcomes for Step 1?\n▪\nIdentify the goal that is the focus of the 4-step process\n▪\nIdentify expected levels of performance\n▪\nDetermine current level of performance\n▪\nMake peer comparison (Determine if it is a Tier 1, 2 or 3 problem)\n▪\nCalculate difference between expected performance and current\nperformance\n.\nPage | 24\nProblem-Solving Process - Step 2: Cause (Problem) Analysis\nWhy is the intended goal or benchmark not being attained?\nProblem Analysis: Analyze the problem using data to\ndetermine why there is a difference between the expected\nand current levels of performance. Generate possible\nreasons (i.e., hypotheses) why students are not attaining\nthe goal) that are founded in evidence-based content\narea knowledge, focused on alterable variables and will\nultimately lead to effective intervention.\nThese hypotheses are typically generated across four domains:\nInstruction, Curriculum, Environment and Learner (ICEL). Hypothesis\nstatements are created in the format of:\n▪\nThe goal is not being attained because ____ (e.g., insufficient opportunity for\npractice of the skill).\nThese statements are then paired with prediction statements in the form of:\n▪\nIf _______ (If additional corrected practice occurs, then the (accuracy of the skill\nwill increase).\nData are collected to determine which hypotheses are most likely to be true (i.e.,\nvalidate or refute). The methods of data collection include:\nReviewing existing records/data, interviewing individuals (student, educators,\nfamily, care providers) with specific knowledge of the situation being addressed,\nObservation of contexts (classroom, school, home, community) in which\nthe desired skill(s) is expected to occur, and testing to identify related\nlearner characteristics. Reviewing, Interviewing, Observation and Testing is\ncommonly referred to as RIOT.\nWhat are the critical actions for step 2?\n▪\nGenerate hypotheses across multiple domains\n▪\nValidate or refute hypotheses using RIOT by ICEL procedures\n▪\nWhat is it about the interaction between the instruction, curriculum, environment\nand learner (ICEL) that is contributing to the problem?\no\nInstruction: How we teach what is being taught\no\nCurriculum: What is being taught\no\nEnvironment: Context where learning is to occur\no\nLearner: Characteristics intrinsic to the individual in relation to the concern\nThe Collaborative Problem-Solving Team (CPST) should collect data using RIOT (Review,\nInterview, Observe, Test) procedures to address each of the above domains. Data\ncollection typically includes review of classwork and assessment data, parent, teacher\nand student interviews, and observations in instructional settings. A RIOT by ICEL\nworksheet can be used to organize the collection of these data is included in the\nappendix. .\nPage | 25\nProblem-Solving Process - Step 3: Intervention Design and Implementing a Plan\nWhat are we going to do to accelerate progress toward the goal?\nIntervention Design: Develop and implement an intervention plan\ndirectly linked to the validated hypotheses. Ask, “What are we going\nto do about attaining the goal established in Step 1?” A detailed\nplan that is matched to the hypothesis identified in Step 2 will\nincrease the likelihood that the intervention will be effective.\nSimply put, if the plan is weak, the results will be weak. To ensure a\nstrong plan, teams must include the following critical components:\n▪\nThe instruction and interventions are evidence-based and\nlinked to the validated hypotheses about why the goal is not\nbeing attained.\n▪\nThe action plan has sufficiency (delivered in sufficient amounts) and\nfidelity (delivered in the way intended by individuals qualified to deliver the\ninstruction).\n▪\nThe plan reflects the integration of instruction, interventions and learning supports\naddressing all of the student(s)’ areas of need and tying results back to success\nwhen engaged in Tier 1 instruction.\n▪\nThe individuals implementing the plan have sufficient support (e.g., time, data,\npeer/coaching) to implement the plan as intended.\nIntervention plans must:\n▪\nexplicitly define the skills to be taught\n▪\nfocus on measurable objectives\n▪\nset realistic goals for the student(s) considering how far below the expectation the\nstudent(s) are\n▪\ndefine who will complete various tasks, when and how\n▪\ndescribe a plan for measuring and monitoring effectiveness of instructional efforts\n▪\nreflect the resources and materials needed\n▪\ninclude a date and time to review the student’s response to the intervention\nWhat are the critical actions for step 3?\n▪\nWhat will be done to address the identified area of concern and ensure that the\ngoal is met?\n▪\ninterventions to validate hypotheses\n▪\nSpecify elements of a comprehensive instructional plan\n▪\nEnsure that Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction/intervention are integrated and\naligned.\n▪\nEnsure that the implementers have sufficient support to implement the plan as\nintended before implementing the intervention, decide:\no\nWhat rate of progress will indicate that a response is positive, questionable\nor poor?\no\nWhat instruction/intervention decisions will be made if a response is\npositive, questionable or poor?.\nPage | 26\nProblem-Solving Process - Step 4: Evaluation of Response to Intervention Data\nDid the plan work?\nEvaluation of Response to Instruction and Intervention Data: Evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe plan by using data gathered from data collection (e.g., progress monitoring) at\nagreed upon intervals. Progress monitoring should directly assess the\ntargeted skill(s). Use this data to determine if the Ask, “Is it\nworking?\" If not, how will the instruction and intervention plan be\nadjusted to better support the progress? The Collaborative\nProblem-Solving Team discussion focuses on how to\nmaintain or better enable learning for the student(s).\nThe effectiveness of the instruction and intervention design\nand implementation must be evaluated to make decisions\nregarding\ncontinuation,\nintensification,\nredesign\nor\ndiscontinuing\nof\nthose\ninstructional\nstrategies\nand\ninterventions. Progress monitoring data are used to make a\ndetermination of whether the effectiveness of the instruction\nand intervention is positive, questionable or poor.\nGuiding Questions:\n▪\nWhat will we do when effectiveness is positive, questionable or poor?\n▪\nIs the instruction and intervention aligned with the verified hypothesis or are there\nother aligned interventions to consider? (Intervention Design)\n▪\nAre there other hypotheses to consider? (Problem Analysis)\n▪\nIs the problem identified correctly? (Problem Identification)\n▪\nShould adjustments be made to ensure the fidelity of the intervention\nimplementation?\n▪\nShould the intervention be intensified by reducing the size of the group, increasing\nthe amount of time and/or frequency that the intervention is delivered, or\nnarrowing the focus of the intervention?\nPositive effectiveness is noted when the gap is closing and the point at which target\nstudent(s) will come in range of the academic and/or behavioral target. The intervention\nshould continue until the student(s) reaches the targeted goal and/or demonstrate\nmastery in Tier 1. Once students achieve mastery, the team should plan how the\nintervention supports will be discontinued. If the response is positive, options are to:\n▪\nContinue intervention with current goal and intensity\n▪\nCreate a new plan to increase or decrease intensity and/or write a new goal\n▪\nDiscontinue intervention plan and provide Universal Tier 1 supplemental supports\nand strategies.\nPage | 27\nQuestionable effectiveness is indicated when the rate at which the gap is widening slows\nconsiderably, but the gap is still widening or when the gap stops widening but\nclosure does not occur. It is neither increasing nor decreasing. If the response is\nquestionable, options are to:\n▪\nReduce the size of the group, increase the amount of time/frequency that the\nintervention is delivered or narrow the focus of the intervention\n▪\nContinue intervention with current goal and intensity\n▪\nCreate a new plan increase or decrease intensity or write a new goal\n▪\nReengage problem-solving cycle\n▪\nEmploy strategies to increase implementation integrity\n▪\nIncrease intensity of current intervention for a short period of time and assess\nimpact. If rate improves, continue. If rate does not improve, return to step 1 of the\nproblem-solving cycle\nPoor effectiveness is suggested when the gap continues to widen with little to no change\nin rate of learning and the student(s) falls further behind. If response is poor, options are\nto:\n▪\nReview intervention fidelity, if no, employ strategies in increased\nimplementation integrity\n▪\nRevisit the problem-solving process\nWhat are the critical actions for step 4?\n▪\nMonitor progress\n▪\nDetermine student response to intervention\n▪\nEvaluate the sufficiency and integrity of the instruction and intervention\n▪\nMake instructional decisions based on student response\nProblem solving within a multi-tiered system of supports involves the provision of high-\nquality instruction and intervention matched to student needs, using learning rate over\ntime and level of performance to make important instructional decisions. The multi-tiered\nsystem is characterized by a continuum of academic and behavior supports reflecting\nthe need for all students to have fluid access to instruction of varying intensity levels.\nThis logic and theme of data-based decision making is embedded in a variety of existing\nstructures such as school improvement, student progression (including student progress\nmonitoring plans and individual educational plan (IEP) present levels and goals),\nreading plans, positive behavior support, Florida State Standards implementation\nand district policies and procedures.\nThe process is also critical for assessing the effectiveness of the instruction and\ninterventions that have been provided. Throughout the continuum of instruction and\nintervention, problem solving is used to match instructional resources to educational\nneeds, which vary across areas of academic content and/or behavioral skills. Teams\ncontinue to engage in problem solving to ensure that student success is achieved and\nmaintained.\nPage | 28\nWhat are Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS)?\nPBIS is a framework that calls for actively teaching positive behaviors and implementing\nevidence-based preventative and responsive interventions to support student academic\nachievement and well-being. In 1997, an amendment of the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (IDEA) included the language, “Positive Behavior Interventions and\nSupports,” which described methods used to identify and support desired behaviors in\nthe school setting. The educational research community has been developing and\nstudying Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) ever since. PBIS\nseeks to reduce or eliminate poor behavior school-wide through the\nencouragement of positive behaviors.\nAs part of a MTSS framework, PBIS can help educators build\nan awesome school culture and address behavioral challenges in a\npositive way. PBIS interventions, when paired with the academic\ninterventions found in RtI, can help students to improve in all areas. The\ntiered structure of a PBIS initiative helps educators to provide students with\nthe help they need to develop the behavioral skills necessary for success.\nThis social-emotional learning coincides with academics, and each can help strengthen\nthe other.\nSchool-wide expectations, tiered systems of supports and consistent data analysis are\nall hallmarks of PBIS. These factors are critical to the success of MTSS, as well. Employing\nthe MTSS framework helps to focus educators and students alike on positive\ninteractions, creating a school climate focused on student success.\nEssential Elements of Successful PBIS Frameworks\nElement\nDescription\nPrevention\nFocus\non\npreventing\nthe\ndevelopment\nand\noccurrence\nof\nproblem behavior, which is more effective, cost‐efficient and\nproductive than responding after patterns have become engrained.\nSchool Culture\nand Behavioral\nExpectations\nBecause children come from many different backgrounds, schools\nmust define core social expectations and overtly teach the behaviors\nand skills associated with these expectations.\nRecognition of\nAppropriate\nBehavior\nStudents should receive recognition of appropriate behavior at rates\nthat exceed the rates of recognition for rules violations and problem\nbehaviors.\nData\nGather data on what behaviors are being observed and use this\ninformation to guide behavior support decisions. Data should include\ninformation related to the setting of the problem behavior.\nInvestment\nDistricts\nand\nschools\nshould\ninvest\nin\nthe\nsystems,\nteams,\npolicies, funding, administrative support, and data structures that\nsupport the implementation of effective practices.\nPage | 29\nSchool-Wide Positive Behavior Plan (SPBP) Essential Elements of PBIS\nThe SPBP consists of 10 Critical Elements which, when implemented effectively and\nconsistently, provide schools the framework to create, monitor and sustain systemic\nand preventative core behavioral interventions for ALL students.\nThese 10 Critical Elements are:\n1. Active team with administrative participation\n2. Faculty and stakeholder commitment\n3. School-wide expectations\n4. Location-specific rules\n5. Reward and recognition programs\n6. Effective discipline procedures\n7. Classroom management systems\n8. Data collection and analysis\n9. Implementation planning\n10. Evaluation\nWhy Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports?\nMany students are not coming to school with the social and emotional skills they need to\nbe successful in the classroom. Punitive measures and zero-tolerance policies are not\neffective in the long-term. But in an environment in which positive behaviors are taught\nand recognized, students can develop into solid citizens, both at school and in the\ncommunity. MTSS creates a positive environment for all students which in turn impacts\nschool climate. Positive school climate is the leading indicator for such outcomes\nas increased academic achievement, increased teacher retention and reduced\ndiscipline referrals.\nPBIS decreases office discipline referrals, increases instructional time and improves\nstudent achievement. It encourages the development of positive teacher-student\nrelationships. In addition, it provides students with the foundational skills they will need for\nsuccess in life.\nThe interventions and supports found in MTSS help in relationship building, which is a key\nfactor in student success. Additionally, a supportive school environment allows each\nstudent to work through their challenges and catch up with their peers. Defined tiers of\nintervention for both academic and behavioral challenges enable educators to address\nstudent needs, both as a group and individually.\nPage | 30\nBenefits of PBIS\nAdmittedly, PBIS can feel foreign to those familiar with traditional punitive discipline\nsystems. But adopting a PBIS framework schoolwide can have incredible benefits:\n▪\nImproves school culture\n▪\nBuilds social skills\n▪\nReduces office discipline referrals\n▪\nReduces suspensions\n▪\nIncreases instructional time\n▪\nImproves social and emotional\ndevelopment\n▪\nImproves school safety\n▪\nIncreases student engagement\n▪\nImproves academic\nperformance\n▪\nIncreases family involvement\n▪\nImproves faculty retention\n▪\nImproves classroom\nmanagement\nAdoption of a PBIS framework has the potential to create radical change in the climate\nof a struggling school. For educators who are seeking to reach and teach every\nstudent in their charge, PBIS makes it possible.\nPBIS Implementation\nIt is tempting to label PBIS as simply a behavioral program. This would imply that it is a\npackaged curriculum designed for use in schools without alteration. However, PBIS is a\ncomplete change in how schools employ interventions and discipline. It is more accurate\nto call PBIS a framework focused on prevention and instruction.\nPBIS represents a radical change in thinking about behavior and discipline. Instead of\nallowing poor behavior to escalate into disciplinary measures, the focus is on teaching\nand promoting positive behaviors. By building on these positive behaviors, escalations\ninto discipline are reduced.\nPBIS Three-Tiered Instructional and Intervention Model\nPBIS uses a three-tiered approach. Each of these three tiers has applications to a\nspecific subset of students.\nPBIS support start with Universal (Tier 1). Schools begin at Tier 1 by creating a school-wide\npositive behavior plan outlining the positive behaviors that they wish to establish school-\nwide. Depending on the school, positive behaviors might include simple actions such as\nwalking calmly in line or throwing away trash in the cafeteria. As the school staff and\nstudents focus on these behavioral goals, negative behaviors begin to lessen. And\nbecause teachers are spending less time in disciplining students, instructional time\nincreases. Approximately 80 - 85% of students never need to move beyond Tier 1 in\ninterventions and support.\nPage | 31\nUniversal\n(Tier 1)\nTargeted\n(Tier 2)\nPBIS Tiers\nTier\n1:\nUniversal\nInstruction\nand\nSupports\nfor ALL Students\n-\nthe\npositive\nbehavior instruction, best practices and positive school climate provided to all students.\nThis tier is focused on preventing the development of new problem behaviors.\nAs the largest tier, and the foundation for the entire framework, it encompasses the entire\nschool with core instructions and basic interventions and supports. This structure helps to\nbuild positive relationships between staff and students. It includes proactive classroom\nmanagement strategies aimed at creating a supportive atmosphere. Students who do\nnot respond to these interventions may move into Tier 2.\nUniversal (Tier 1) Instruction and Supports are:\n▪\nSchool-wide\n▪\nFor all students, staff members and settings\n▪\nDesigned to reduce problem behaviors\n▪\nIncreases instructional time\nAccess resources: http://flpbis.cbcs.usf.edu/tiers/tier1.html\nTier 2: Targeted Interventions and Supports for Some Students - the supports provided to\nstudents who are either not responding to Tier 1 supports and/or are at risk for serious\nproblem behaviors. Students needing Tier 2 supports are identified based on data (e.g.,\nnumber of problem behaviors). Tier 2 interventions are typically small group setting\ninterventions.\nSome students need a little extra assistance in meeting academic and behavioral goals,\nand it is in Tier 2 that these individuals receive that help. Often these interventions and\nsupports are delivered in small group settings, such as reading groups. Check-In/Check-\nOut (CICO) interventions are often a part of Tier 2, as well. This targeted support allows\nstudents to work toward catching up with their peers. These efforts focus on specific\ngroups of students and the underlying issues that may be causing the behavior.\nDisruptive students may be dealing with social, emotional or academic issues that\nresult in poor behavior in the classroom. Tier 2 interventions parse out the hidden\ncauses behind negative behavior and provide support in changing those behaviors.\nTargeted (Tier 2) Interventions and Supports are:\n▪\nGroup supports for some students\n▪\nSpecialized interventions for students\ndemonstrating at-risk behavior\n▪\nPrevents worsening of problem behaviors\nAccess resources: http://flpbis.cbcs.usf.edu/tiers/tier2.html\nPage | 32\nIntensive\n(Tier 3)\nTier 3: Intensive Individualized Interventions and Supports for a Few Students - the supports\nprovided to the small percentage of students with serious problem behaviors who do not\nrespond to Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions. Tier 3 gives these students individualized supports\nand can include assistance from outside agencies such as behavioral counselors or\nfamily therapists. These interventions target students who exhibit high-risk behavior. Such\ninterventions might take the form of a positive behavior intervention plan created\nto address specific academic, behavioral and/or social-emotional concerns.\nIntensive (Tier 3) Interventions and supports are:\n▪\nIndividual support for a few students\n▪\nSpecialized interventions for students with high-risk behavior\n▪\nDesigned to reduce severity of ongoing problem behaviors\nAccess resources: http://flpbis.cbcs.usf.edu/tiers/tier3.html\nImplementing a PBIS framework can have a significant effect on overall school climate.\nStudents are more productive, teachers are happier, and the larger community benefits.\nPerhaps most importantly, PBIS allows educators to do more of what they love – teach!\nConceptualized as a three-tiered framework, this continuum of evidence-based\npractices of RtI and PBIS applications is best represented as a blended integration that\nhas relevance and application across the range of teaching and learning environments\nthat exist in schools.\nProblem-\nSolving\nDescription\nExample\nStep 1: Problem\nIdentification\nPinpoint the problem in\nmeasurable terms.\nNot: \"The student is lazy.\"\nInstead: \"The student's rate of work completion is\n40%, while the expectation is 100%.\"\nStep 2: Analyze\nthe Problem\nConsider the student\nand instructional\nenvironment to\ngenerate hypotheses\nabout causes\nNot: \"The student must have a disability and needs\nto be tested because his/her rate of work\ncompletion is low.\"\nInstead: \"The student has not mastered key skills; the\nwork assigned is above his/her instructional level.\"\nStep 3:\nInstructional\nDesign and\nImplementation\nUse evidence‐based\ninterventions to\naddress the identified\nproblem.\nNot: \"I'll provide preferential seating for the student\nnear my desk.\"\nInstead: \"I'll use targeted curricula to supplement\ncore instruction in the area of difficulty.\"\nStep 4:\nResponse to\nIntervention\nUse data‐based\ngraphing to monitor\nintervention outcomes.\nNot: Anecdotal or intuitive tracking of intervention\noutcomes.\nInstead: Graphing of work completion on a weekly\nbasis during the intervention period compared to\nthe baseline.\nPage | 33\nFidelity of Implementation\nFidelity of implementation is the delivery of instruction in the way in which it was designed\nto be delivered. Fidelity must also address the integrity with which screening and\nprogress-monitoring procedures are completed and an explicit decision-making model\nis followed. Interventions and supports must be implemented with fidelity.\nThe aim of fidelity of implementation is to ensure that both the school process of MTSS\nand classroom instruction at various tiers are implemented and delivered as intended.\nThis aim must be balanced with the school's existing resources. General education in\nUniversal (Tier 1), using a standard treatment protocol, is an important beginning to the\nRtI/PBIS process. Several key components lead to high fidelity and several key indicators\nare evidence of implementation with fidelity. To assure fidelity of implementation,\nmonitoring procedures must be in place to measure the five elements of fidelity,\nadherence,\nexposure,\nquality\nof\ndelivery,\nprogram\nspecificity and\nstudent\nresponsiveness.\nAdherence answers the following questions:\n▪\nHow well do you stick to the plan?\n▪\nHow well do you adhere to the curriculum or the instruction or the intervention as\nintended?\n▪\nHow well do you stay true to an intervention and avoid the drift?\nDuration and exposure answer questions about how often a student receives an\nintervention, for how long each time and for how many weeks. We can think of this\nelement in terms of learning opportunities, as number of days in a week or minutes per\nday for delivery of curriculum. When we talk of providing more intense instruction, we\noften increase the duration and exposure, and thereby provide more learning\nopportunities.\nQuality of delivery relates to the quality with which the teacher or the instructional staff\nperson delivers the curriculum.\n▪\nWas the instructor’s enthusiasm evident?\n▪\nWas the instructor engaged in delivering the content?\n▪\nWas the instructor making sure that students were engaged, that students were\nunderstanding the material and if not, doing something to change that?\n▪\nWas the instruction explicit? strategic? systematic? scaffolded?\nProgram specificity is concerned with avoiding contamination, i.e., being careful not to\nadd a few things from one set of materials and something else from another set.\nStudent responsiveness must be considered. You can have high adherence, the right\nexposure, an enthusiastic teacher doing a great job delivering, clear program specificity, but\nif students are not engaged, it is all for naught.\nKey Indicators of Implementation Fidelity in General Education\n▪\n80-85% students pass grade level standards-based assessments\n▪\nHigh percentage of students on trajectory for grade and age\nGuiding Tools for Instructional Problem Solving – Revised (GTIPS-R)\nIntervention Documentation Worksheets \nIntervention documentation worksheets were developed as an efficient means of collecting information regarding the actual minutes \nof supplemental or intensive instruction/intervention delivered in a self‐report format. Each day of the week has a column to designate \nthe Time, Focus, and Program for the intervention session that day. \n\nTime (T) is entered as the length of time the intervention was actually delivered, measured in minutes.\n\nThe Program (P) column is used to indicate the particular program or materials used for the intervention. The legend\nat the bottom of the page gives the user the opportunity to create a key for the specific program or materials used.\n\nThe Focus (F) of the intervention is entered using the legend at the bottom of the page or a key the user develops. For\nthe purposes of this worksheet, the Focus is defined as the particular skill targeted by the instruction/intervention.\n\nThe Total Number of Minutes is summed for the individual weeks, then those totals are summed and compared to\nthe number of minutes originally prescribed in the intervention plan. This allows the important assessment of fidelity\nof the amount of planned instructional/intervention support.\nFor example, if the intervention is planned to occur on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week for 20 minutes each day for four \nweeks,  that  would  be  a  planned  total  of  240  extra  minutes  of  instruction.  If,  after  examining  the  Intervention  Documentation \nWorksheet, it is evident that, as a result of absences, field trips, and assemblies, only an average of 30 minutes of intervention per \nweek was provided over the four weeks, then a total of 120 minutes of extra support would have actually been provided. When \nevaluating the student’s response to instruction/intervention, it is essential to understand the actual amount of support received by \nthe student(s). Accurate data are necessary before accurate instructional decisions can be made. In the scenario above, without \ndocumentation of implementation fidelity, we may think that we are evaluating the effects of 240 minutes of additional support when, \nin fact, only 120 minutes of additional support had been provided. Supports to improve implementation fidelity are put in place when \nthe actual amount of instruction is less than the planned amount of instruction. As well, continued focus on the identified instructional \ntarget (F) and on use of identified materials (P) is documented to ensure consistency throughout the intervention. \nWorksheet A is formatted for recording individual student interventions. Worksheet B has been modified to record groups of students \n(as when providing small group supports) by replacing the row headers of Week 1, Week 2, etc., with the names of the students in the \nintervention group. A worksheet records one week of data in this case; thus, a new sheet is created each week. \nGuiding Tools for Instructional Problem Solving – Revised (GTIPS-R)\nIntervention Documentation Worksheet for Individual Students\nNote: This is a digital form.

At Universal (Tier 1), this is\nfacilitated using universal screeners at specifically scheduled times of the year, including,\nbut not limited to, baseline, mid-year and end-of year. At Targeted (Tier 2) and Intensive\n(Tier 3), progress monitoring is used to assess student(s) progress or performance in those\nareas in which a learning gap was identified through Universal (Tier 1) data analysis.\nThese progress monitoring measures serve to quantify student rate of improvement, or\nresponsiveness to instruction, and to assist in the evaluation of the effectiveness of\ninstruction and interventions currently in place. When planning for progress monitoring,\nattention should focus on fidelity of implementation and the selection of evidence-based\nstrategies, interventions and resources. There should also be specific steps taken to\nensure cultural and linguistic responsiveness, as well as the recognition of student\nstrengths. Problem-solving is not complete without intervention evaluation, evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the intervention. The goal on this final stage is to answer the question:\n“Is the intervention working?” by reviewing the data collected for individuals or groups.\nPositive Response\n▪\nGap is closing\n▪\nPoint at which target student(s) will “come in range” of target can be\nextrapolated even if this is long range\nPotential Actions\n▪\nContinue intervention with current goal\n▪\nContinue intervention with goal increased\n▪\nDiscontinue intervention to determine if student(s) has acquired functional\nindependence\nPage | 38\nQuestionable Response\n▪\nRate at which gap is widening slows considerably, but gap is still widening.\n▪\nGap stops widening, but closure does not occur\nPotential Actions\n▪\nDetermine if the intervention was implemented as intended\n▪\nIf not, employ strategies to increase implementation integrity\n▪\nIf yes, increase intensity of current intervention for a short period of time and assess\nimpact. If rate improves, continue. If rate does not improve, return to problem\nsolving\nPoor Response\n▪\nGap continues to widen with no change in rate\nPotential Actions\n▪\nDetermine if intervention was implemented as intended\n▪\nIf not, employ strategies to increase implementation integrity\n▪\nIf yes, increase intensity of current intervention for a short period of time and assess\nimpact. If rate improves, continue. If rate does not improve, return to problem\nsolving\no\nIs intervention aligned with the verified hypothesis? (Intervention Design)\no\nAre there other hypotheses to consider? (Problem Analysis)\no\nWas the problem identified correctly? (Problem Identification)\nThe period of time an intervention is required to be implemented is described in the\nliterature as “reasonable and realistic” and is left up to the school based problem-solving\nteam to determine. Florida State Board Rule 6A-6.0331 (1) (e), FAC states: “Interventions\nshall be implemented as designed and for a reasonable period of time and with a level\nof intensity that matches the student’s needs.”\nPage | 39\nUltimately, the student’s response to intervention will determine the length of time that\nhe/she will be exposed to the intervention. Certain factors should be taken into\nconsideration when attempting to determine a reasonable period of time for a particular\nstudent’s intervention plan and progress monitoring checkpoints:\n▪\nHow far below expectations the student is performing (the further below\nexpectations the student is performing, the longer it will take him/her to close the\ngap with peers)\n▪\nThe skill to be learned (some skills naturally take longer to learn than others)\n▪\nThe intensity of the instruction needed\n▪\nThe point in the school year at which the interventions are first implemented\n(interventions may need to continue into the next school year before benchmarks\ncan be expected to be achieved)\n▪\nStudent factors such as health, motivation, attendance and/or family issues that\nmay impact performance\nRegardless of the skill being monitored by plotting data points collected from ongoing\nprogress monitoring on a graph, trends in student performance must be visualized. The\ntrajectory will reveal the type of response obtained.\nGraphic Representations of Response to Intervention (RtI)\nData demonstrating rate of progress and levels of performance in comparison with\nmultiple subgroups are used to monitor student progress throughout a student’s\neducation. Graphic representations are a means of effectively presenting raw data to\nparents, students and education professionals involved in problem identification,\nanalysis and intervention planning, and they convey the degree to which a child\nresponds to the interventions being provided.\nFlorida State Board Rule 6A-6.0331 (1) (e), FAC states: pre-intervention and ongoing\nprogress monitoring measures of academic and/or behavioral areas of concern must be\ncollected and communicated to the parents in an understandable format, which may\ninclude, but is not limited to, graphic representation. Fewer conflicts arise when all parties\nare able to fully understand the data regarding the school’s implementation of\ninterventions and the student’s responses to these interventions over time.\nData collection should match the intensity of the instruction that is being provided. In\ngeneral, students receiving intensive, individual interventions (commonly described as\ntier 3 interventions) should be monitored weekly until enough data points are gathered\nto obtain a reliable trend line. In contrast, groups of students receiving targeted\ninterventions (commonly described as tier 2 interventions) may be monitored bi-weekly\nor even monthly.\nPage | 40\nCollaborative Problem-Solving Teams\nEach school is expected to create and support a MTSS School-Based Leadership Team\n(SBLT) utilizes the problem-solving process to meet the academic and behavioral needs\nof all students. MTSS is a framework that is used for all team-based educational decision\nmaking. The MTSS Leadership team is identified in each school’s School Improvement\nPlan (SIP). The school-based leadership team should be composed of various\nstakeholders at the school level such as administrators, teachers, content specialists and\nother relevant staff with an array of expertise.\nCollaborative Problems Solving Teams (CPS Teams) are intervention driven/progress\nmonitoring teams at each school that assist students, families and teachers in identifying\npositive solutions for all students. CPS Teams examine factors that may be impacting\nacademic, behavioral and social-emotional success for students (i.e., instruction,\ncurriculum, environment and learner-centered variables).\nThey are comprised of professionals within the school community (i.e., school\nadministrators, teachers, school psychologists, guidance counselors, school social\nworkers, speech/language clinicians, reading specialists) and other relevant personnel,\nincluding community agencies when necessary. The combined expertise of these\nprofessionals along with parent input increases the likelihood that the team will\naccurately determine the cause of the student’s problem and develop effective\nsolutions.\nThe primary goal of CPS Teams is to support teachers and parents by generating effective\nresearch-based academic and behavioral strategies, interventions and supports for\nstudents in need of more intensive and/or individualized instruction. These teams follow\nthe four-step problem solving process and use school, class and individual student data\nto monitor the effectiveness of programs and interventions.\nRoles and Responsibilities for Collaborative Problem-Solving Team (CPS Team)\nAccountability for positive student outcomes is the shared responsibility of all school\npersonnel. There are specific roles that must be filled for the CPS Team to function\neffectively. The people assigned to fulfill these roles may vary by school site, depending\nupon the expertise and availability of personnel. Responsibilities of all CPS Team members\ninclude but are not limited to:\n▪\nEnsures MTSS implementation\n▪\nEnsures the problem-solving model is followed\n▪\nSupports the fidelity of the problem-solving process\n▪\nMonitors fidelity of intervention implementation\n▪\nInterprets and analyzes universal screening and subgroup comparative data\n▪\nIdentifies strategies, supports,

While\nthese two approaches to RtI are sometimes described as being very different from each\nother, they actually have several common elements. In practice, many schools and\ndistricts combine or blend aspects of the two approaches to fit their needs. Regardless,\nto better understand them, these two approaches are described separately.\nIn the problem-solving approach, a collaborative problem-solving team is used for\nselecting interventions and making decisions, this allows for more brainstorming and\nflexibility in the process. The CPS Team considers student performance data to identify\nand define learning problems, to develop interventions to solve those problems, and to\nevaluate the effects of the interventions on the defined problem or problems.\nThe problem-solving model is a logical organizer to manage and evaluate system data,\nprioritize targets, and implement and evaluate individual intervention. Studies have\ndemonstrated positive effects of the problem-solving model in schools, but this type of\nmodel is perhaps the most vulnerable to misapplication because the procedures and\ndecision-making criteria are flexible and not well specified. The outcomes of the problem-\nsolving model depend heavily on the procedures used. Problem-solving procedures are\nnot well specified, allowing for flexibility across sites but also causing variable or unreliable\neffects. While unique intervention is planned for each identified student in the problem-\nsolving approach, in the standard protocol approach interventions are defined, the\ncomponents are well specified and have been shown to work generally for large\nnumbers of students.\nThe second major approach is called the standard treatment protocol approach and is\nsupported by a strong research base. The words standard (consistent, the same for all\nstudents), treatment (instruction, intervention), and protocol (predetermined format or\ndelivery system) describe this approach to RtI. This option uses one validated intervention,\nselected by the school, to improve the academic or behavior skills of its struggling\nstudents. Because a single, consistent intervention is used, it is easier to ensure accurate\nimplementation, or treatment fidelity. Additionally, a variety of support staff can deliver\nthe instruction; however, it is critical that they receive comprehensive training before\nassuming their instructional responsibilities. They also need to receive ongoing support\nand professional development while delivering the standard treatment protocol\nprocedures to ensure that the intervention is delivered correctly.\nA standard protocol model is typically used for common problems for up to\napproximately 20% of the students in each grade-level. Typically, the SBLT, based on its\nschool data and resources, creates the standard protocol plan and updates the plan\nquarterly. The standard protocol model involves the provision of a research-based\nintervention for a specific amount of time, duration, and frequency (i.e., minutes per day,\ndays per week, and number of weeks) for small groups of students having similar needs.\nPage | 45\nA primary feature of the standard protocol model involves standardized instruction or\nintervention with minimal analysis of skill deficits.\nThe intervention has a set of well-defined steps or procedures, which when implemented\nappropriately, increases the probability of producing positive outcomes for\nstudents. Intervention groups are formed by identifying the general nature of the deficit\nand matching it to a prescribed treatment or protocol. Because the procedures within\na standard protocol model are clear and specific, intervention fidelity should be easy to\nverify. The problem-solving method is used for students who need more specific\ninterventions to address their individual needs.\nResearch has demonstrated strong effects for RtI models in each of the above models.\nHence, there is no right or wrong model of RtI. Effects obtained under any RtI model\ndepend on the quality with which implementation occurs. To attain strong positive effects\non student learning outcomes, schools must focus heavily on the accuracy of decisions\nmade at each stage of implementation. Effective implementation requires that schools\nimplement procedures to do the following:\n▪\nCorrectly identify students who need intervention\n▪\nDeliver intervention that effectively resolves the learning problem for the majority\nof students exposed to the intervention\n▪\nMonitor the effects of the intervention and to ensure intervention integrity and\npositive effects on learning\n▪\nMake decisions about the need for more intensive or less intensive intervention\n(e.g., progressing to higher tiers or lower tiers, discontinuing intervention)\n▪\nLink resulting RtI data to Universal (Tier 1) decisions and outcomes\n▪\nLink resulting RtI data to referral and eligibility decisions in special education\n▪\nLink resulting RtI data to system programming changes (e.g., resource allocation,\nprofessional development, program evaluation)\nThere is a direct and irrevocable relationship between how well schools do the above\nactivities and their effects on student learning. That is, the effects obtained depend on\nthe degree to which the above actions are correctly carried out. To select a model,\ndistricts or schools should evaluate existing practices and resources at their sites to\ndetermine the approach that will best help them accomplish the seven activities listed\nabove. Models of implementation are the appendix for consideration and review.\nResource inventories for academic, behavior and support staff are included in the\nappendix of this guide. These are fluid documents that will change as data reveal which\ninterventions are most effective. Problem solving teams should use the resource\ninventories as guides when creating standard protocols and interventions for their\nschools. All schools are expected to have standard protocols for reading, math and\nbehavior. These protocols should be updated at a minimum quarterly.\nEstablished 1915\nBROWARD\nMulti-Tiered System of Support\nCounty Public Schools\nModels of Implementation: Best Practice Model\nExpectations\nSBLT coordinates Tier 1 instruction and supports,\nestablishes, monitors and evaluates school-wide\nacademic and behavioral expectations, programs and\noutcomes.

Parents can be involved in the process by communicating any\nconcerns to the child’s teacher, providing insight into their child’s learning and\ndevelopment and assisting with identified interventions at home.\nParents and guardians are students’ first teachers and biggest advocates and play an\nimportant role in accelerating their students’ success. CPS Teams should include parents\nin the intervention and support process from the beginning and throughout the process.\nHere are a few strategies to inform, include and leverage parent and guardian expertise\nduring the MTSS process:\nIntroduce the CPS Team to Parents. Ensure that parents know who the CPS Team\nmembers are, the nature of the team’s work and how to contact the team if the parent\nhas a concern. This can be done during a variety of times in the year.\nPost MTSS information, resources, materials and contact information on the school’s\nwebsite. The content will help parents understand the process. Include documents that\nexplains the school’s MTSS protocol, gives MTSS team contact information and lists\nresources and interventions that parents can use at home.\nInvite parents to CPS Team meetings. Parents must be informed when their student needs\nadditional support and intervention. Send home a meeting invitation that outlines the\npurpose of the meeting and with flexible meeting options, such as call in line or attending\nvirtually. Additionally, collect information from the parent before the meeting to assist\nwith the efficiency of the meeting.\nAttend report card conferences. Have CPS Team members present at report card\nconferences for students receiving or in need of intervention. Show parents student data\nand clarify how a student is progressing or declining. Use the time to make suggestions of\ninterventions parents can continue at home to support the student or to suggest an MTSS\nmeeting to further develop a student learning plan.\nSupport parents. Let parents know their involvement and support is appreciated. Help\nparents to remember that they aren't alone, and that the school supports them. CPS\nTeams can do great work together, but in collaboration with parents, the work is much\nstronger.

MTSS encompasses\nResponse to Intervention (RtI and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS).\nMTSS Information for Parents and Families\nWhat is Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS)?\nWhat is Response to Intervention (RtI)?\nRtI is the practice of providing high quality instruction and intervention matched\nto student need and close monitoring of how a student responds to different\nlayers of instruction and support.\nWhat are the benefits of MTSS?\nThe overall goal of MTSS is to improve educational outcomes for all students by\nidentifying student needs early and making sure student needs do not go unmet.\nMTSS focuses on using data to make decisions about adjusting teaching or providing\nextra supports so students do better in school. Schools use MTSS to build a system of\ncombined instruction and support (or “interventions”) for students at varying levels of\ni\nntensity, based on each student’s need. MTSS is for all students.\nWhat are Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS)?\nPBIS are the methods used to identify and support desired behaviors in the school\nsetting through the encouragement of positive behaviors school wide.\nHow can I participate in MTSS?\nFamilies play a critical role in supporting\nwhat their children are learning in school.\nThe more parents are involved in student\nlearning,\nthe\nhigher\nthe\nstudent\nachievement.

Data-based problem-\nsolving means that data are used effectively to improve learning and informs instruction\nintervention and support at all levels and in all settings.\nThe problem-solving process incorporates at least the following four steps in a cyclical,\nrecurring model to address prevention, early intervention, and intensive intervention:\nStep 1. Define: Problem Identification\nWhat is the problem? How does the student’s/ group’s performance compare to\nbenchmark level of performance and peers’ level of performance?\nStep 2. Analyze:\nProblem Analysis\nWhy is the problem\noccurring?\nWhat would happen if\n_____ would occur? Can\nwe validate our ideas?\nStep 3. Implement:\nIntervention Design\nWhat are we going to do\nabout the problem? What\nwill we teach? How will we\nteach it? Is instruction\nmatched to the problem\nwe identified?\nStep 4. Evaluate:\nResponse to\nIntervention (RtI)\nIs the instruction and\nintervention working?\nHow do we know? Is\nacademic and/or\nbehavior performance\nimproved?\nAre outcomes for all students equitable? Is the group’s/student’s response good,\nquestionable, or poor?

the domains of instruction, curriculum, environment and learner (ICEL) through the\nuse of reviews, interviews, observations and tests (RIOT) in order to evaluate\nunderlying causes of a problem and to validate hypotheses. Time spent on\nproblem analysis increases the likelihood that the resulting intervention will be\nsuccessful.\nThe ICEL X RIOT matrix is not a data collection instrument. Instead, it is an organizing\nframework, or process, that increases a schools’ confidence both in the quality of the\ndata they collect and the findings that emerge from the data.\nWhy use it?\nA common mistake that schools often make is to assume that student learning\ndifficulties exist primarily in the learner and to underestimate the degree to which\nteacher instructional strategies, curriculum demands and environmental influences\nimpact the learner’s academic performance. The ICEL elements ensure that a full\nrange of relevant explanations for student learning difficulties are examined.\nRIOT Defined\nRIOT (Review, Interview, Observation, Test). The top horizontal row of the RIOT/ICEL\ntable includes four potential sources of student information: Review, Interview,\nObservation, and Test (RIOT). Schools should attempt to collect information from a\nrange of sources to control for potential bias from any one source.\nReview existing information. This category consists of past or present records collected\non the student. Obvious examples include but are not limited to report cards,\nconference notes, office disciplinary referral data, state test results and attendance\nrecords.\nLess obvious examples include, but are not limited to, student work samples, physical\nproducts of teacher interventions (e.g., a sticker chart used to reward positive student\nbehaviors), and emails sent to a parent detailing concerns about a student’s\nperformance, experiences and skills.\nInterview (parents, teachers, student). Interviews can be conducted face-to-face, via\ntelephone or even through email correspondence. Interviews can also be structured\n(that is, using a pre-determined series of questions) or follow an open-ended format,\nwith questions guided by information supplied by the respondent.\nMTSSICELRIOTGUD – 082019\nPage 2 of 5\nICEL by RIOT Matrix – Guide for Problem Analysis\nObservation of student during instruction. Direct observation of the student’s academic\nand behavioral skills, study and organizational strategies, degree of attentional focus\nand general conduct can be a useful channel of information. Observations can be\nmore structured (e.g., tallying the frequency of call-outs or calculating the percentage\nof on-task intervals during a class period) or less structured (e.g., observing a student\nand recording a running narrative or anecdotal of the observed events).\nTest student skills. Testing can be thought of as a structured and standardized\nobservation of the student that is intended to test certain hypotheses about why the\nstudent might be struggling and what school supports would logically benefit the\nstudent. An example of testing may be a student being administered a math\ncomputation probe, a Benchmark Assessment System (BAS) or another skills test.\nICEL Defined\nICEL includes four key domains of learning to be assessed: Instruction, Curriculum,\nEnvironment, and Learner (ICEL).\nInstruction- How Content is Taught The purpose of investigating the ‘instruction’ domain\nis to uncover any instructional practices that either help the student to learn more\neffectively or interfere with the student’s learning. More obvious instructional questions\nto investigate would be whether specific teaching strategies for activating prior\nknowledge better prepare the student to master new information or whether a student\nbenefits optimally from the large-group lecture format that is often used in a classroom.\nA less obvious example of an instructional question would be whether a student learns\nbetter through teacher-delivered or self-directed, computer-administered instruction.\nCurriculum – What Content is Taught Curriculum represents the full set of academic skills\nthat a student is expected to have mastered in a specific academic area at a given\npoint in time. To adequately evaluate a student’s acquisition of academic skills, of\ncourse, the educator must (1) know the school’s curriculum (and related state\nacademic performance standards), (2) be able to inventory the specific academic\nskills that the student currently possesses, and then (3) identify gaps between curriculum\nexpectations and actual student skills.\nEnvironment – The ‘environment’ includes any factors in the student’s school, community\nor home surroundings that can directly enable their academic success or hinder that\nsuccess. Obvious questions about environmental factors that impact learning include\nwhether a student’s educational performance is better or worse in the presence of\ncertain peers and whether having additional adult supervision during a study hall results\nin higher student work productivity.\nMTSSICELRIOTGUD – 082019\nPage 3 of 5\nLess obvious questions about the learning environment include whether a student has a\nsetting at home that is conducive to completing homework or whether chaotic hallway\nconditions are delaying that student’s transitioning between classes and therefore\nreducing available learning time.\nLearner – While the student is at the center of any questions of instruction, curriculum and\n[learning] environment, the ‘learner’ domain includes those qualities of the student that\nrepresent their unique capacities and traits. More obvious examples of questions that\nrelate to the learner include investigating whether a student has stable and high rates of\ninattention across different classrooms or evaluating the efficiency of a student’s study\nhabits and test-taking skills. A less obvious example of a question that relates to the\nlearner is whether a student harbors a low sense of self-efficacy in mathematics that is\ninterfering with that learner’s willingness to put appropriate effort into math courses.\nMTSSICELRIOTGUD – 082019\nPage 4 of 5\nRIOT to Analyze ICEL Domains\nDOMAINS\nR (Review)\nI (Interview)\nO (Observe)\nT (Test)\nInstruction\nThe teacher may\nsearch for comments\nfrom former instructors\nabout instructional\ntechniques to which\nthe student did or did\nnot respond.\n\nPermanent\nproducts e.g.\nwritten pieces,\ntests, worksheets,\nprojects\nInterviews about\nInstruction may include\ninterviews with:\n\nTeachers regularly\nuse of effective\nteaching\npractices,\nexpectations,\nalignment of\ninstructional\ncurriculum,\npreferred\npractices, RtI\nimplementation\n\nOther\nstaff/personnel,\ninterventionist,\ncoaches,\nadministrators,\nmentors\nObservations about\nInstruction may\ninclude observations\nof:\n\nTeaching\npractices\n\nEffective\npractices\n\nExpectations\n\nAntecedents,\nconditions,\nconsequences\nTest hypotheses\nregarding\ninstructional factors:\n\nMake possible\nadjustments to\ninstruction to\neffect change\n\nRecord the\nresponse to\nadjustments\nmade to\ninstruction\nCurriculum\nReview of Curricula\nmay include review of:\n\nPermanent student\nproducts\n\nScope and\nsequence of\nlessons (e.g.,\nwriting, tests,\nquizzes,\nworksheets,\nprojects)\n\nState and district\nmandated\nbenchmarks and\nstandards\nInterview regarding\ncurriculum may\ninclude:\n\nTeachers\nphilosophy, use of\ncurricular\nmaterials,\naccommodations/\nmodifications\n\nOther\nstaff/personnel:\ninstructional\nphilosophy, district\nimplementation,\nexpectations,\ncurricula\n\nObservations of\naccess strategies\nand modified\nmaterials\n\nAlignment of\ncurriculum to\nmaterials and\nassessments\nObservations about\ncurriculum may\ninclude:\n\nAccess strategies\nand modified\nmaterials\n\nAlignment of\ncurriculum to\nmaterials and\nassessment\nTest hypotheses\nregarding curricular\nfactors.\n\nMake possible\nadjustments to\ncurriculum to\neffect change\n\nRecord student\nresponse to\nadjustments\nmade to\ncurriculum\nMTSSICELRIOTGUD – 082019\nPage 5 of 5\nDOMAINS\nR (Review)\nI (Interview)\nO (Observe)\nT (Test)\nEnvironment\nReview of the\nenvironment may\ninclude:\n\nSchool and\nclassroom rules\nand expectations\n\nPolicies on\nbehavior support\n\nResponse to\ndisruptive behavior\n(e.g., who,\nhow, when,\nwhere)\n\nClass size and\nprogram type\nInterviews about the\nenvironment may\ninclude interviews with:\n\nTeachers and\nother\nstaff/personnel\nregarding\nclassroom routines,\nrules and\nexpectations,\nbehavior\nmanagement\nplans,\nreinforcement,\ncontingencies,\noverall climate for\nlearning\n\nFamily regarding\nschool and\nclassroom rules\nand expectations,\nhome or\ncommunity factors\nObservations of the\nenvironment may\ninclude\nobservations of:\n\nEnvironmental\nanalysis\n\nIndividual vs. class\ncompliance\n\nDistractions\n\nPatterns of\ninteractions\namong adults\nand students\n\nThe physical\nenvironment\n\nOverall climate\nTest hypotheses\nregarding\nenvironmental\nfactors\n\nMake possible\nadjustments to\nthe environment\nin order to effect\nchange\n\nRecord student\nresponse to\nadjustments\nmade to\nenvironment\nLearner\nReview of the learner\nmay include review of:\n\nHealth records\n\nCumulative\nRecords\n\nPermanent\nproducts\n\nIEPs or 504s\n\nIntervention\nrecords\nInterviews about the\nlearner may include\ninterviews with:\n\nTeachers, staff,\nfamily about their\nperception\nof the problem\nbehavior, patterns\nof behavior\n\nThe student about\nhis/her actions,\nperception\nObservations of the\nlearner may include\nobservations of:\n\nPresent levels of\nperformance\n\nResponse to\nInterventions (RtI)\n\nuse and\neffectiveness of\nsupport strategies\n\nPatterns of\ninteractions with\nadults and\npeers\nTest hypotheses\nregarding personal\nfactors and/or\nfunction(s) of the\nstudents’\nBehavior.\n\nAdjust\ninteractions with\nthe Learner to\neffect change\n\nRecord response\nto adjustments\nmade about the\nlearner\nMTSSICELRIOT – 072019\nPage 1 of 4\n ICEL X RIOT Guiding Questions\nGuiding questions for engaging in problem-solving, effective data collection and problem analysis across all levels, content\nareas and tiers\nSources of Data\nWhere you might find this information\nGuiding Questions\nWhy you are looking for this information\nReview\no\nPermanent products\no\nClassroom work (demands of the task,\ndifficulty levels and skill requirements)\no\nScope and sequence of lessons\no\nCurriculum materials (books,\nworksheets, curriculum guides)\no\nClass schedules\no\nLesson plans/IEP goals\no\nWhat are the skill requirements for the academic task?\no\nHow successful is this student compared to peers on student evidence?\no\nHow systematically were outcome data collected from interventions?

While\nMassachusetts leads the nation in performance on\nmultiple measures, we still have students who are\nnot experiencing the success they deserve.\nRecent reports such as the “Review of\nSpecial Education in the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts: A Synthesis Report” by Hehir\nand Associates (2014) and “No. 1 for Some:\nOpportunity and Achievement in Massachusetts”\nby the Massachusetts Education Equity Partnership\n(2018) demonstrate the consequences of an\ninequitable education system for students with\ndisabilities, students who are English learners,\neconomically disadvantaged students, and\nstudents of color in Massachusetts.\nThis is not because these students can’t or don’t\nwant to learn. We must recognize that many of our\nschools are not organized to meet the needs of all\nlearners (Meyer, Rose & Gordon, 2014).\nAlthough some students face barriers that have\nthe potential to interfere with their ability to make\noptimal progress, there is evidence that schools\nand classrooms can raise student achievement\ndespite these barriers (Hattie, 2018; Meyer, Rose,\nand Gordon, 2014).\nFor example, through efforts such as wrap-around\nservices, the use of high-quality core curricular\nmaterials, evidence-based interventions, trauma\ninformed practices, and strategies to engage\nall learners, schools have the ability to address\nfactors that may impact student learning. Schools\ncan minimize or eliminate barriers and improve\nstudent outcomes when they design equitable,\ntiered, universally-designed systems of support\nthat address students’ academic, behavior, and\nsocial emotional well-being in ways that are\nculturally sustaining.\nMTSS is a framework designed to meet the needs\nof all students by ensuring that schools optimize\ndata-driven decision making, progress monitoring,\nand evidence-based supports and strategies with\nincreasing intensity to sustain student growth.\nMTSS is not just about tiered interventions, but\nrather how all the systems in a school or district fit\ntogether to ensure a high quality education for all\nstudents.\nTo realize this success, multi-tiered systems must\nbe supported by leadership, competency, and\nimplementation drivers to ensure that district\nresources and efforts are focused on supporting\nall students, who can and will learn and succeed\nwith our support.\n2\n3\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nS E C T I O N 1\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF\nSUPPORT (MTSS)\nWhat is MTSS?\nAccording the Every Student Succeeds Act\n(ESSA, 2015), a multi-tiered system of support is\n“a comprehensive continuum of evidence-based,\nsystemic practices to support a rapid response to\nstudents’ needs, with regular observation to facilitate\ndata-based instructional decision making.’’\t\nHarlacher et al. (2014) described six key tenets of the\nMTSS framework:\n\n All students are capable of grade-level learning\nwith adequate support.\n\n MTSS is rooted in proactivity and prevention.\n\n The system utilizes evidence-based practices.\n\n Decisions and procedures are driven by school\nand student data.\n\n The degree of support given to students is based\non their needs.\n\n Implementation occurs school-wide and requires\nstakeholder collaboration.\nThe current MTSS model in Massachusetts has been\nrefined from previous versions. For example, this\nblueprint more explicitly focuses on equitable access\nand universal design for learning (UDL) and fully\nintegrates social emotional and behavioral supports\nwith academic supports (Lane, Oakes, Cantwell, &\nRoyer, 2016).\nWhat is the difference\nbetween MTSS and RtI?\nResponse to intervention (RtI)\nwas added to the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education\nAct in 2004 as an alternative\nevaluation procedure.\nThe goal of RtI was to provide\nscreening for all students, deliver\nacademic interventions, monitor\nstudent progress, and use the\nstudents’ responses to those\ninterventions as a basis for\ndetermining special education\neligibility (Turse & Albrecht, 2015).\nESSA distinctly references multi-\ntiered systems of support, but there\nis no reference to Response to\nIntervention (RtI), and in fact they\nare two distinct tiered approaches.\nWhile RtI focuses on direct services,\nsupports, and interventions\nfor students at risk, MTSS is\na systematic approach that\naddresses conditions for creating\nsuccessful and sustainable\nsystem change while also\nsupporting students and staff.\nAs opposed to a reactive\nmodel that responds to student\nachievement declines as a\nrationale for resources and\nservices, MTSS puts the onus\non the system, not the student,\nand is proactive in getting all\nstudents what they need.\n4\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nB L U E P R I N T\nC O M P O N E N T S\nFoundational\nFramework\n& Focus\nTiered Support\nSystem\nDrivers\nFoundational Framework and Focus\nThis blueprint will unpack the components of a\nmulti-tiered system of support (MTSS) through the\nfoundational framework of universal design for\nlearning (UDL) and a focus on equitable access.\nTiered Support\nMTSS provides a continuum of supports, which\nare typically conceptualized across three levels of\nincreasing intensity (Rodriguez, Loman & Borgmeier,\n2016).\nThese tiers represent the level of support a student\nmay need at any point in his/her/their schooling. All\ntiers are universally designed using the principles of\nUDL and ensure equitable access for all students.\n\n Academic\n\n Behavioral\n\n Social Emotional\nSystem Drivers\nThis section will review the conditions and systems\nnecessary to support a robust and effective MTSS\napproach, inclusive of the following drivers.\n\n Leadership Drivers\n\n Competency Drivers\n\n Implementation Drivers\n5\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nM T S S V I S U A L\nIntensive\nSupport\nTIER 3\nTargeted Support\nTIER 2\nUniversal Support\nTIER 1\nAcademic\nBehavioral\nSocial Emotional\nU\nN\nI\nV\nE\nR\nS\nA\nL\nD\nE\nS\nI\nG\nN\nF\nO\nR\nL\nE\nA\nR\nN\nI\nN\nG\nE\nQ\nU\nI\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\nA\nC\nC\nE\nS\nS\nLeadership\nDrivers\nCompetency\nDrivers\nImplementation\nDrivers\nM U L T I - T I E R E D\nS Y S T E M O F S U P P O R T\n6\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nS E C T I O N 2\nFOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK & FOCUS\nUDL (Universal Design for Learning)\nUniversal design for learning (UDL) is a framework that reduces barriers in instruction,\nproactively provides appropriate accommodations and supports, and allows for high-\nachievement expectations for all students, regardless of their unique strengths and\nchallenges. This is done by providing options and choices for students to personalize\ntheir learning. UDL is an educational framework based on research in cognitive\nneuroscience that guides the development of flexible learning environments that can\naccommodate learner variability.\nU D L\nF R A M E W O R K\nC O M P O N E N T S\nMultiple Means of\nEngagement\nThe Why of Learning\nMultiple Means of\nRepresentation\nThe What of Learning\nMultiple Means of\nAction & Expression\nThe How of Learning\nThe UDL framework, first defined by David Rose, Ed.D. of the Harvard Graduate School\nof Education and the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) in the 1990’s, calls for\ncreating curriculum from the outset that provides:\n\n Multiple means of engagement to tap into learners’ interests, challenge them\nappropriately, and motivate them to learn,\n\n Multiple means of representation to give learners various ways of acquiring\ninformation and knowledge, and,\n\n Multiple means of expression to provide learners with options for demonstrating\nknowledge and skills.\nInstructional planning, as defined in the UDL literature, has four parts: goals, methods,\nmaterials, and assessments (Meyer, Rose & Gordon, 2014). UDL is intended to increase\naccess and engagement in learning by reducing physical, cognitive, intellectual, and\norganizational barriers, as well as other obstacles. Instructional goals, through the UDL\nlens, focus on standards-based instruction and the design of instruction that allows all\nstudents to have equitable access to grade-level standards in learning experiences that\nare engaging and personalized to their needs. UDL principles also lend themselves to\nimplementing inclusionary practices in the classroom, including behavioral and social\nemotional teaching and learning.\n7\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nEquitable Access\nAll students receive challenging, grade-appropriate tier I instruction and have equitable\naccess to high quality, universally designed academic, behavioral, and social emotional\ncurriculum and instruction that integrates culturally sustaining pedagogy and is\nlinguistically responsive. In our planning, it is important to ensure equitable access to\nhighly qualified teachers along with comprehensive efforts to diversify our workforce.\nPiper et al. (2006) define access as the ability to obtain a seat in a classroom or to\nreceive services, whereas equity is the ability to obtain that seat or service regardless\nof “ethnicity, language spoken at home, gender, rural or urban location, or regional\ndifferences” (p. 2). All students, regardless of disability, English language proficiency\nstatus, income, race, or academic performance can receive tier 1, 2, and 3 services.\nCulturally sustaining pedagogy “describes teaching and learning that seeks to\nperpetuate and foster linguistic, literary, and cultural pluralism as part of the democratic\nproject of schooling and as a needed response to demographic and social change”\n(Paris, 2017, p.2). To provide equitable access to tier 1, districts need to ensure that all\nteachers have access to high-quality curricular materials that support them in crafting\nlearning experiences that are inclusive and socially just for all students. To do this, school\nsystems have to implement asset and strength-based approaches to teaching and\nlearning.\nFor example, we must ask ourselves how we can support the dynamic mix of abilities,\nraces, ethnicities, classes, genders, neighborhoods/regions, religions, and interests of our\nstudents, staff, families, and communities. When planning instruction, we must consider\ncritical questions like, “Do our schools represent the students and families as they\nbelieve themselves to be?,” “What interests and engages our students, staff, families, and\ncommunity?,” and “How do we leverage the skills, capacities, and strengths within our\ncommunity as we design learning experiences that meet the needs of all students?”\nTo ensure equitable access, districts must recognize all students as general education\nstudents first, and recognize diversity and inclusion as a necessary good. As a result,\nthe focus of MTSS should be creating strong tier 1 systems and supports that are\nsupplemented, not replaced, by tier 2 and tier 3 supports.\n8\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nS E C T I O N 3\nTIERED SUPPORT\nThe problem-solving process in MTSS is an ongoing methodology for effective decision\nmaking at all levels of the system and across all three tiers (Council of the Great City\nSchools, 2012). The tiers in this model represent instruction and supports.\nWithin the MTSS model, universal supports such\nas high quality, universally designed, culturally\nsustaining, and evidence-based curriculum,\ninstruction, and assessments are provided for all\nstudents.\nMovement amongst the three tiers is fluid\nand is not determined or defined by specific\ndesignations, such as diagnosed disabilities.\nRather, movement is supported by data from\nuniversal screeners, diagnostic assessments,\nprogress monitoring, and how a student responds\nto one level of intervention.\nAny and all students should have access to\nsupports when they need them. In addition,\nobtaining services at one point does not mean that students will always need that level\nof support. The MTSS process is not always linear, but rather oriented around problem-\nsolving.\nWhen data suggests that students require more or less intensive supports to aid either\nremediation or enrichment, they will move throughout the tiers based on that need.\nNo student should be labeled by an intervention tier. For example, a child is not a “tier 2\nstudent” but rather a student requiring tier 2 supports in a specific skill/content area(s).\nIn addition, when a student receives interventions in tier 2, it should not replace tier 1\nsupports. These supports build upon one another. Moreover, students can move fluidly\nthrough tier 1, 2, and 3 supports as needed. For example, if data suggests that students are\nnot meeting the standards, what additional supports may they need? Similarly, if students\nsignificantly exceed the standards, what tier 2 supports may be necessary to optimize\nchallenge and promote growth? It’s also important to note that students may need tier 2\nsupports in one area (e.g., math standards) but may need only tier 1 supports in another\narea (e.g., relationship-building).\nIntensive\nSupport\nTIER 3\nTargeted Support\nTIER 2\nUniversal Support\nTIER 1\n9\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nIntensive\nSupport\nTIER 3\nTargeted Support\nTIER 2\nUniversal Support\nTIER 1\nIntensive\nSupport\nTIER 3\nTargeted Support\nTIER 2\nUniversal Support\nTIER 1\nIntensive\nSupport\nTIER 3\nTargeted Support\nTIER 2\nUniversal Support\nTIER 1\nTier 1\nThese are supports available to all students through a general\neducation program. Inclusive practice, which is linguistically\nresponsive and culturally sustaining, is a cornerstone of tier 1.\nInclusive practice is defined as “instructional and behavioral\nstrategies that improve academic and social emotional\noutcomes for all students, with and without disabilities, in general\neducation settings” (Educator Effectiveness Guidebook for\nInclusive Practice, 2017). For example, providing students with\na high-quality, coherent curriculum that provides options and\nchoices for how they learn (i.e, access to books, videos, or direct-\nteacher instruction), what materials, scaffolds and supports they\nneed to learn (i.e., visuals, exemplars, graphic organizers, rubrics,\netc.), and how they can express what they have learned will allow\nmore students to access rigorous, standards-based instruction.\nTier 2\nTier 2 supports occur in addition to the supports that are\nprovided in tier 1 settings. These supports are generally done in\nsmall groups and include additional opportunities to practice\nthe skills necessary for core instruction or strategies for\nenrichment.\nTier 3\nTier 3 provides more intensive support. These are often explicit,\nfocused interventions that occur individually or in very small\ngroups. It is important to note that tier 3 is not synonymous with\nspecial education. Students with disabilities may not need tier 3\nsupport and students not identified with a disability may in fact\nneed tier 3 supports.\n10\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nCase in Point: Tiered Support\nImagine a grade 6 classroom where all students\nhave access to a high-quality core curriculum\nthat is universally designed and attends to\nsocial emotional learning in all content areas.\nThere is also a\nstrong school-wide\nPositive Behavioral\nInterventions and\nSupports (PBIS)\nsystem, which\nis supported by\nteacher classroom\nmanagement.\nThe classroom\nteacher utilizes\nuniversal screening tools with all students,\nconsistently monitors their progress, and\nreceives high-quality professional development\nin evidence-based practices and ongoing\ncoaching support aligned to the curriculum.\nAll students receive tier I supports in the\nclassroom and the teacher frequently monitors\nstudent progress. While reviewing student data\nwith the school data team, the team notes\nthat there are a few students whose needs are\nnot being fully met by the tier I supports.\nThe teacher has two students who have recurring\nbehavioral challenges during her literacy class.\nThe grade/cohort level team should compare\nnotes on whether those students have persistent\nbehavioral challenges or if they only occur during\nliteracy. If the former, they may collectively confer\nwith the student support worker and decide\nwhether a social skills/\ntier 2 or tier 3 support\nwould be helpful and\nappropriate. If the\nlatter, it may have\nmore to do with that\nparticular teacher’s\ninstructional style\nor relationship with\nthe students.\nTwo additional\nstudents struggle with decoding multi-syllabic\nwords, which significantly affects their reading\ncomprehension. In addition to working with\nthe students in small groups during reading\nworkshop, the teacher refers those students to\nthe reading specialist who determines that they\nwould benefit from an evidence-based reading\nintervention. After six weeks, the data team will\nreview student progress and determine next steps.\nAlthough these students have varying needs,\nMTSS allows all of them to access rigorous and\nengaging learning opportunities in tier I as well\nas research-based supports in tiers 2 and 3.\nAlthough students have a range of\ndifferent needs, MTSS allows all of\nthem to access rigorous and engaging\nlearning opportunities in tier I as well as\nresearch-based supports in tiers 2 and 3.\n10\n11\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nS E C T I O N 4\nSYSTEM DRIVERS\nLeadership Drivers\nImplementation requires leaders who address the adaptive issues (such as consensus\nbuilding and identifying/removing barriers that interfere with the development of an\neffective multi-tiered system) paired with technical support (such as finding time for\nteachers to collaborate and providing curriculum resources). Hall and Hord (2011) found\na .74 correlation (significant to the .01 level) between the adaptive leadership style of an\nadministrator and implementation success. This driver also refers to the structures that\nfoster collaboration and stakeholder input.\nShared Responsibility & Collaboration\nIn an effective multi-tiered system, representative stakeholders with decision-making authority team\ntogether to collaboratively lead planning and implementation efforts using communication feedback\nloops and purposeful meeting structures. District and school leadership teams regularly use\nformative and summative data to evaluate systems, strategies, policies, and student outcomes. This\ndata is used to inform action plans at the district, school, classroom, and individual student levels.\nLeaders are encouraged to consider the process of supporting MTSS as a long term commitment.\nRobust changes take ongoing prioritization and commitment along with long-range planning.\nWithout thoughtful planning, initiatives are not likely to be implemented with fidelity. We sometimes\nrefer to this pattern as the “rain not hitting the ground” (i.e., high level decisions are made but the\nchanges and practices are not seen at the classroom level).\nLeaders should consider the following stages in their planning. The planning stages below were\nadapted from the National Implementation Research Network1:\nE X P L O R AT I O N\nDuring the exploration stage, the team learns more about multi-tiered systems and recognizes\nthe need to build a system that meets the needs of all students. During this stage, teams may ask\nthemselves:\n\n What is MTSS?\n\n What will it take to implement a multi-tiered system of support in our school or district?\n\n How will we assess our readiness for change so we can eliminate barriers that may prevent\nsuccessful implementation of MTSS?\n 1. National Implementation Research Network, 2018. Used with permission.\n12\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nP L A N N I N G\nDuring the planning stage, teams create strategic plans for how they will acquire the resources needed\nto create an effective multi-tiered system of support. For example, providing initial training for staff,\nfinding or establishing performance assessment tools to measure success, and ensuring teachers have\naccess to high-quality curricular materials are steps that need to be in place before the work can be\ndone effectively. During this stage, teams may ask themselves:\n\n What are our goals and do we have a defined action plan?\n\n What early professional learning needs to occur to build the foundation for implementation?\n\n How will we measure success?\n\n How do we engage all stakeholders in understanding the relevancy of this work?\nI N I T I A L I M P L E M E N TAT I O N\nDuring the initial implementation phase, schools and districts begin to implement a multi-tiered system\nof support. During this stage, teams may ask themselves:\n\n What structures are in place (e.g., new schedules) to support early implementation changes?\n\n How do we support early innovators with robust scaffolds and supports such as PD and coaching?\n\n How are we using data to drive our work?\n\n How much time is provided for early adopters to collaborate and reflect on their new practices?\n(Senge & Kleiner, 1999).\nF U L L I M P L E M E N TAT I O N\nFull Implementation is reached when 50% or more of the intended practitioners, staff, or team members\nare implementing the identified strategies with fidelity and seeing strong outcomes for all students.\nDuring this stage, teams may ask themselves:\n\n How will we scale up the professional learning options to meet the needs of the early adopters as\nwell as those just beginning?\n\n How are we using data to refine our system of support?\n\n How do we maintain a focus on this work through transitions in leadership?\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Leadership Team - There is an active leadership team that takes on the responsibility of ensuring\nthat systems meet the needs of all learners. The team has the authority to make resource,\nscheduling, programmatic, and staffing decisions and has representation from a range of\nstakeholders (including curriculum & instruction, student support, special education, and English\nlearner departments).\n\n Communication & Collaboration Structures - The leadership team uses effective mechanisms to\nnot only collaborate internally (e.g., agendas, protocols), but to regularly seek input and feedback\nfrom key stakeholders (including staff, students, families, and the community) and to communicate\nimportant information and decisions. All stakeholders are committed to the work and regularly\nparticipate in planning and implementation activities.\n\n Policies and Procedures - Policies are established by the school committee to support equity\n(e.g., ensuring the annual budget funds schools equitably according to need; requiring an equity\naudit to be conducted on a regular basis to determine factors such as institutional bias). Similarly,\nadministration defines procedures to ensure that all students can be successful in the school system\n(e.g., proportional scheduling is used to ensure that all students have access to higher level courses;\ncodes of conduct are developed with an equity lens). All policies and procedures are followed with\nfidelity.\n13\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\n\n Scientifically-Based Planning Model - A multi-year planning process is used to\nthoughtfully examine data and identify priorities, conduct a root cause analysis and\ndevelop a logic model for how to address those priorities, and create an action plan to\nsustainably roll out, implement, and monitor the required systems and strategies identified\nthrough the logic model. The action plan is integrated into existing district and school\nimprovement/strategic plans and details who is responsible for what, by when, and what\nfoundational actions need to be taken so that the work can occur.\nResource allocation\nIt is essential that resource mapping occurs and districts prioritize and allocate their people,\ntime, and funding in a way that optimizes the tiered systems needed to support their students.\nThe National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) (2018) outlines how proactive, vigorous,\nand enthusiastic attention by the administration is used to reduce implementation barriers while\nsupporting practitioners.\nSchool leaders are encouraged to make strategic use of staffing, scheduling, and budgeting.\nResource allocation is a tangible way that leaders show their priorities. If MTSS is a focus,\nwhat resources have been provided to support it? How is staffing prioritized to support tiered\nsystems of support? How have we organized our schedules to support tiered instruction? Do we\noffer substantive time for professional development? These questions can be used as starting\npoints to determine priorities for building effective multi-tiered systems.\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Tiered Scheduling - The schedule allows time for evidence-based instruction and\ninterventions to be delivered across all three tiers in order to meet the academic, social\nemotional, and behavioral needs of students. In addition, the schedule does not remove\nstudents from the school’s educational program to receive intervention (i.e., schools are\nsupplementing and not supplanting tier 1 services and are not removing students from\nlunch/recess and specials like physical education and music). The schedule allows for time\nto administer assessments to determine the specific needs of all students.\n\n Common Planning Time - Time is scheduled for department-, grade-, and student-level\nteam collaboration and critical follow-up activities. Common planning times allow for\nplanning across grade levels and content teams and are inclusive of interventionists, special\neducators, English learner teachers, and student support staff. There are effective protocols\nto guide these meetings. There is also time allotted for staff to analyze assessment data\nand determine the appropriate supports for each student (e.g., who needs support in\nintervention blocks; time for the pre-referral process) and what monitoring is needed.\n\n Inclusive and Equitable Resources - The budget, staffing models, and master schedule\nare reviewed with a lens of inclusion and equity (e.g., do we ask questions like, “What is the\ntypical proportion of learners with diverse needs in the general education classroom—for\nexample, students who are English learners (ELs) or students with individualized education\nprograms (IEPs)?” and “What is the composition of students enrolled in advanced, honors,\nand AP courses?”). Based on answers to those questions, the team makes decisions to\nmodify the schedule and allocation of resources to move toward a more inclusive learning\nenvironment. Student needs and performance data drive the fiscal and asset management\nprocess.\n13\n14\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nStudent, Family, & Community Engagement\nCollaboration between students, staff, families, and community partners is a key component\nin determining and providing appropriate supports for all students. Defined strategies for\nengagement are essential, such as the use of collaboration protocols, communication plans,\nfeedback loops, stakeholder surveys, targeted outreach efforts, etc. (Ðurišic & Bunijevac,\n2017). Involving families in the development of an effective tiered system helps to ensure the\ndevelopment of culturally sustaining and linguistically appropriate models of support.\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Welcoming Environment & Relationships - The district and schools create a welcoming\nculture and environment for all families/caregivers, students, school staff, and community\nmembers. Stakeholders are valued and connected to each other in support of high\nacademic expectations, achievement, and healthy development and wellbeing.\n\n Effective Communication - Families/caregivers, school/district staff, and administration\nengage in regular, meaningful dialogue about learning, high academic expectations, and the\nhealthy development of students. Schools systematically share information using multiple\ncommunication pathways and solicit input about school goals and initiatives with students,\nfamilies, and the broader community.\n\n Engagement in Student Support - Families/Caregivers and students are actively engaged\nin student support processes/decisions and regularly informed about progress. Families/\ncaregivers receive the information they need to advocate for their children and are informed\nof their rights to request a special education evaluation at any time during the tiered support\nprocess.\n15\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nCompetency Drivers\nCompetency drivers revolve around building educator capacity to affect positive\nstudent outcomes through thoughtful staffing models, offering high quality\nprofessional development, research based coaching strategies, and effective, aligned\nsystems for feedback and evaluation (NIRN, 2018).\nStaff Recruitment, Selection, & Onboarding\nWe need to look at our students’ needs and specifically hire staff who have the relevant expertise\nto meet them. This requires a mindset and belief that all students can learn at high levels. This\nbelief should be evidenced in our procedures for recruitment, in the staff we select, and how we\npurposefully integrate our core beliefs in our onboarding programs (O’Connor & Freeman, 2012).\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Core Understanding and Beliefs - All staff have a firm understanding of the components\nand value of MTSS and believe that all students can be successful with appropriate levels of\nsupport.\n\n Hiring and Onboarding - Hiring criteria, recruitment, and selection for all district/\nschool administrators, educators, and other staff include knowledge, skill, and experience\nimplementing MTSS. Onboarding programs and strategies support the building of MTSS\nexpertise and skill sets.\n\n Staffing Design - The staffing model and staff roles are designed to support implementation\nof MTSS based on students’ needs. Careful consideration is given to staff titles and duties\nto foster a positive approach to meeting the needs of all students. In addition, staff are (re)\nallocated based on student need annually and throughout the year (e.g., if additional tier 2\nsupports are identified as a need, staff schedules should be adapted to offer the necessary\nsupports).\n16\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nProfessional Development & Coaching\nDistricts need a sustainable professional development plan that offers high-quality, on-going\nsupport, individualized and team professional development and coaching, as well as options to\nestablish academic, behavioral, and social emotional expertise at all three tiers (Freeman, Miller,\n& Newcomer, 2015). This professional development needs to be designed to meet the needs of\nall learners while also aligning to the Massachusetts Standards for Professional Development\n(Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 2015). These standards remind\nimplementation teams to ensure that professional development is goal-directed, data-informed, and\ncollaborative so that all educators are engaged in learning experiences that allow them to apply the\nprofessional learning in their practice.\nFacilitators of professional development should model good pedagogical practice and engage\nall educators using the principles of universal design for learning (UDL), the same principles that\nincrease access and engagement for students in a multi-tiered system (Novak & Rodriguez, 2016).\nDesigning professional development using UDL principles ensures that all educators have options\nand choices to learn about multi-tiered systems of support in ways that are relevant, authentic, and\nmeaningful; have access to numerous scaffolds and resources that support both understanding\nand implementation; and have numerous opportunities to demonstrate their understanding and\napplication of multi-tiered systems and receive feedback on their professional journey. Teachers\nneed ongoing, job-embedded professional development opportunities to practice skillful use of the\ndistrict’s curricular materials and deepen their understanding of how strong tier 1 instruction supports\ngreater access to grade-appropriate content for all students.\nIn addition to high-quality professional development, educators need coaching systems to apply\ntheir conceptual understanding of MTSS by implementing new skills, engaging in reflective dialogue\nwith someone with experience in using the strategies, and embedding these skills into daily practice\n(Freeman, Miller, & Newcomer, 2015).\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n High Quality PD - Adequate time is provided for professional development to support the\nfoundations of MTSS (such as PD on universal design for learning and culturally sustaining\npractices) and those professional learning options are embedded into the district and school PD\nplans. Staff actively participate in high-quality, universally designed, and ongoing PD with the\ngoal of improving instructional practice and student outcomes. The PD meets the Massachusetts\nStandards for Professional Development and focuses on student academics as well as the social\nemotional/behavioral/mental health dimensions of learning.\n\n Adult Learning Culture - District and school culture is conducive to adult learning, where all staff\nhold themselves jointly responsible for student outcomes and regularly share their strengths\nand struggles in the spirit of helping each other continually improve practice. Professional\ndevelopment offerings are guided by data and student outcomes.\n\n Coaching - Specific staff are identified for advanced training in meeting the academic, social\nemotional, and behavioral needs of students (i.e., coaches). Coaches use multiple points of\nevidence to identify potential professional development priorities for teachers. Both teachers and\ntheir coaches work to draw out the connections between teacher actions, student actions, and\nstudent outcomes. Coaches work with teachers to determine the most appropriate professional\ndevelopment activities to efficiently close gaps in their practice or to build upon existing\nstrengths. Coaching needs and functions are identified at both the district and school-levels and\nare reviewed at least annually.\n17\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nFeedback & Evaluation\nIt is also important to align MTSS efforts with the Massachusetts Educator Evaluation Framework.\nExisting DESE resources (e.g., the Educator Effectiveness Guidebook for Inclusive Practice (2016b))\nsupport these efforts with resources such as sample SMART goals, sample artifacts/evidence of\npractice, and related rubric elements.\nDESE’s Turnaround Practices Research (2016a) provides some examples of how to support feedback\nand evaluation.\n\n Defined expectations for rigorous and consistent instructional practices - School leadership\nhas identified a clear instructional focus and shared expectations for instructional best practices\nthat address clearly identified, student-specific instructional needs\n\n Administrative observations leading to constructive, teacher-specific feedback, supports, and\nprofessional development - There is a defined and professionally valued system for monitoring\nand enhancing classroom-based instruction across the school and for individual teachers. The\nsystem includes frequent observations of instructional practice and the impact of instruction on\nstudent work, team-based and job-embedded professional development, and teacher specific\ncoaching, when needed.\nIn addition, feedback loops will help with fidelity checks. It is important to ask students and staff for\ntheir opinions about MTSS implementation from the end-user standpoint.\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Feedback to Support Implementation - The district utilizes feedback data (e.g., learning walk\ndata; evaluation ratings) to inform ongoing PD, planning, and implementation support.\n\n Academic Focused Feedback & Evaluation - The educator evaluation process is used to\nprovide formal and informal feedback related to meeting the academic needs of students. The\nfeedback is used to develop meaningful, actionable goals to improve practice and impact student\nachievement. Academic and social emotional/behavioral practice goals are integrated where\nappropriate.\n\n Social Emotional & Behavioral Focused Feedback & Evaluation - The educator evaluation\nprocess is used to provide formal and informal feedback related to meeting the social emotional\nand behavioral needs of students. The feedback is used to develop meaningful, actionable goals\nto improve practice and impact student outcomes. Social emotional/behavioral and academic\npractice goals are integrated where appropriate.\n18\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nImplementation Drivers\nImplementation drivers are the organizational systems that leaders create in\norder for tiered instruction and interventions to take place.\nTiered Continuum of Evidence-Based Practices\nEvidence-based practices, instruction, and systems are provided to students by tier. Universally\ndesigned practices and supports are intrinsic to all tiers. The supports provided to students are\ndefined by their needs.\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015) emphasizes the use of evidence-based activities,\nstrategies, and interventions (collectively referred to as “interventions”).\nThe term “evidence-based”means an intervention that demonstrates a statistically significant\neffect on improving student outcomes or other relevant outcomes. The criteria for identifying\n“evidence-based” interventions based on each of ESSA’s four levels are as follows:\n\n Strong evidence from at least one well-designed and well-implemented experimental\nstudy;\n\n Moderate evidence from at least one well-designed and well-implemented quasi-\nexperimental study;\n\n Promising evidence from at least one well-designed and well-implemented correlational\nstudy with statistical controls for selection bias; or\n\n Demonstrates a rationale based on high-quality research findings or positive evaluation\nthat such activity, strategy, or intervention is likely to improve student outcomes or other\nrelevant outcomes; and includes ongoing efforts to examine the effects of such activity,\nstrategy, or intervention.\nThe Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) has identified\nthe following required and allowable uses of the ESSA evidence-based provisions. Unless\notherwise specified, “evidence-based” means “meets any of the four evidence levels described\nabove.”\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Academic Supports & Interventions - Tier 1 academic expectations are articulated and\nknown by all. Within tier 1 there is a range of supports to meet the needs of all learners.\nIn addition, there is a range of tier 2 and 3 academic interventions (supplemental to tier\n1) targeted to specific skills/needs of the student and identified by assessment data. All\ninstruction, interventions, and supports are evidence-based, culturally sustaining, and\nuniversally designed. Data is used to monitor the effectiveness of interventions regularly.\n\n Social Emotional and Behavioral Supports & Interventions - Tier 1 social emotional\nand behavioral supports are articulated and known by all. Within tier 1 there is a range\nof supports to meet the needs of all learners. In addition, there is a range of tier 2 and 3\n19\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nsocial emotional and behavioral interventions (supplemental to tier 1) targeted to specific\nneeds of the student and identified by data. All instruction, interventions, and supports are\nevidence-based, culturally sustaining, and universally designed. Data is used to monitor the\neffectiveness of the interventions regularly.\n\n Supporting Students with Disabilities - IEPs are designed to enable the student to\nprogress effectively in the content area of the general curriculum and within the life of the\nschool. This ensures the student has access to the least restrictive environment and tiered\nsupports as appropriate. Inclusive practice and inclusion are cornerstones of educational\nprogramming.\n\n Supporting English Learners - The district and schools ensure English learners are able to\naccess the general curriculum and the tiered system of support. Data (e.g., ACCESS) is used\nto measure student proficiency in reading, writing, listening, and speaking English, as well\nas the progress they are making in learning English. This data is used to inform supports\nprovided to students.\nImplementation Fidelity\nOften, schools deliver professional development to staff but then do not have systems in place\nto follow up on whether staff are utilizing the practices effectively. A core component of this\nwork is to establish a systematic approach to monitoring our adherence to the designed tiered\nsystem of support. In addition to practice, it is important that we have mechanisms to review\nfuture improvement plans, planning procedures (e.g., the budgeting process), and policies to\nsupport MTSS throughout the implementation stages.\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Measures & Processes to Monitor Fidelity - Fidelity measures are identified to assess the\nimplementation of evidence-based strategies, instruction, and interventions. Measures can\nbe at the district, school, and classroom levels and build a common understanding of what\nsuccess looks like (e.g., you might regularly assess that evidenced-based curriculum and\ninstructional systems exist through curriculum reviews and classroom observations). Clear\nprocesses are in place to determine how, when, and who will assess the fidelity measures.\n\n Mid-course Corrections & Continuous Improvement - Based on the data collected\nthrough the fidelity monitoring and feedback loops, decisions are made about how to\nenhance the effectiveness of the work (e.g., shifting approaches, providing additional\nprofessional development and support, etc.). These processes are designed to support\nopen communication and productive feedback to ensure the work can be successfully\nimplemented and sustained.\n19\n20\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\n20\nData-Based Decision Making\nTeams of educators use formative and summative evaluation procedures to make decisions\nabout student intervention/instruction using scientifically-validated assessments for screening,\ndiagnostic, and progress monitoring purposes. These teams engage in a strategic problem\nsolving process to identify student needs and designate intervention and progress monitoring\nprotocols. The district and school leadership teams will also use student assessments to\nevaluate district/school-wide outcomes, consider how to make programmatic and instructional\ndecisions based on those outcomes, and use this data to inform the MTSS action plan.\nBelow are some examples of what this looks like based on the DESE Turnaround Practices,\n2016a.\n\n Teachers and teacher teams use student data to adapt and improve instructional\nstrategies - Teachers use and analyze a variety of student-specific data to assess the\neffectiveness of their instructional strategies and practices and modify instruction to meet\ntheir students’ needs as identified.\n\n Using data to identify student-specific academic, social emotional, and behavioral\nneeds - Administrators and teachers use a variety of ongoing assessments (formative,\nbenchmark, and summative) to frequently and continually assess instructional\neffectiveness and to identify students’ individual academic needs (e.g., content or standard-\nspecific academic needs) in order to provide student-specific interventions, enrichment, and\nsupports.\n\n Monitoring progress to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention - The school\nengages in ongoing monitoring of the impact of tiered interventions and adjusts school’s\nstructures and resources (e.g., time, staff, schedules) to provide interventions to students\nthroughout the year.\t\nBelow are additional samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Data Culture and Competency - A culture exists that supports the use of data not solely\nfor accountability purposes, but to drive instructional decisions and identify and address\ninequities. Staff can articulate the value of using aggregated and disaggregated data to\nsupport all students and professional development time is dedicated to help staff learn how\nto use data to drive instruction and monitor interventions. Data is used to assess systems\nin the district and schools that may be impacting equity and outcomes for all students. For\nexample, regular equity audits are conducted at the school and district levels to identify\nwhere students are disproportionately impacted by policies, practices, and/or instruction.\n\n District and School Data Systems - District and school-level data systems are used to\ntrack student performance over time. These data systems are used to provide regular\nperformance feedback to school teams, coaches, and individual staff for problem solving,\nprofessional development, and action planning. Data systems are not only inclusive of\nthe data sets/platforms, but the meeting times and protocols needed to utilize the data\neffectively.\n\n Assessment Maps - The district and schools have annual assessment maps. The\nassessment map includes universal screeners, diagnostic assessments, and progress\nmonitoring tools focused on academic skill development as well as social emotional and\nbehavioral development.\t\n21\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nHigh Quality Curriculum and Instruction\nEducators should not see the implementation of standards as a distinct initiative from the focus on\nMTSS. We must assess the resources and planning tools we use at all three tiers and review their\nalignment to the standards. Whether we are using grade level standards or entry and access points,\nplanning models for all students should focus on foundational skills in collaboration with standards.\nBelow are samples of what this may look like in practice.\n\n Universally Designed and Culturally Sustaining Instruction - The district has a process to\nreview instructional methods and strategies to ensure that they are universally designed (e.g., to\ndetermine accessibility and engagement) with a lens of equitable access (e.g., materials are free\nof bias). In turn, teachers’ pedagogy reflects the principles of UDL and is culturally sustaining.\n\n Standards Incorporated Into Tiers - State standards are addressed across all three tiers. For\nexample, the instructional goals and resources used at all three tiers are reviewed and assessed\nfor their alignment to the standards (grade level, access, or entry points).\n\n High Quality Materials - Materials across all three tiers exhibit a coherent sequence of target\nskills and knowledge (i.e., they are vertically and horizontally aligned), have an empirical\nevidence of efficacy, and include engaging content and inclusive design.\n22\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nS E C T I O N 5\nFOCUS AREAS\nTo optimize student success, schools must address the academic, behavioral, and\nsocial emotional needs of students through tiered support. All three areas are mutually-\nreinforcing and should be at the core of our MTSS work. Depending on local context\nand needs, many districts may choose to broaden the scope of their MTSS approach to\nexplicitly include tiered supports for safety, physical & mental health needs, and social\n& family service needs. The systems and principles of the MTSS Blueprint can also be\napplied to those domains (or others).\nAcademic Support\nThe design of academic instruction should allow all students equitable access to\ngrade-level standards, or entry points, in learning experiences that are engaging and\npersonalized to meet their needs. Academic instruction integrates evidence-based\npractices in all content areas so students can make effective progress. Below is an\nexcerpt from the Resource Guide to the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for\nStudents with Disabilities that explains the role that entry points plan in this work.\n“Students with disabilities are expected to achieve the same standards as their non-disabled\npeers. However, they may need to learn the necessary knowledge and skills differently, including\ntheir presentation at lower levels of complexity, in smaller segments, and at a slower pace. While\nthe standards define the concepts, skills, and content that should be taught and learned by all\nstudents in each grade, the 2018 Resource Guide identifies “entry points” for each standard that\nallow educators to teach standards-based skills that encourage students to approach the grade-\nlevel standard. It is especially suited for instructing students with significant disabilities who take\nthe MCAS Alternate Assessment (MCAS-Alt) because it aligns less complex skills and content with\ngrade-level subject matter, and allows students to progress along a continuum as they approach\ngrade-level complexity (Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,\n2018).”\nStudents need to be actively involved in the learning process using evidence-based\ncurriculum and pedagogical strategies to foster engagement. For example, the principles\nof UDL remind educators to provide options and choices for students to set goals for\ntheir improvement as they work toward standards, choose the appropriate level of\nchallenge by selecting the methods and materials that will increase motivation, select\nthe scaffolds and supports that best meet their learning needs, and minimize threats\nand distractions in the classroom so all students can work collaboratively on their\npersonalized learning plans with support from the teacher. When implementing the\nprinciples of UDL, all students have opportunities to engage in rigorous academic work,\nas this access is a primary predictor of student achievement (Council of the Great City\nSchools, 2012).\n23\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nCase in Point: Academic Support\nIn many classrooms, teachers design a “one-\nsize-fits-all” academic curriculum for learners.\nFor example, when designing instruction, many\nteachers expect\nstudents to read\nprinted text like\nnovels, primary\nsource documents,\nand/or textbooks\nto learn content\nand then answer\nquestions about\nthe content using\ntextual evidence in\npredictable formats, like the five-paragraph essay.\nPrinted materials result in barriers for some\nstudents, who may not be able to access the text\nbecause they cannot decode at that level, have\nvisual impairments, or are English learners.\nIn a universally designed high school classroom,\nstudents may have options about which texts to\nread, or they may be encouraged to choose a novel\nbased on interest, that is relevant, authentic, and\nmeaningful as they work to meet the standard.\nIf reading the same text, students may have the\noption to read the hard copy or access the text\nonline, where they can customize the display of\nsummarize sections to\nbuild comprehension.\nWhen expressing their\nunderstanding of the\ntext, teachers may ask\nquestions at different\ndepths of knowledge\nand encourage\nstudents to answer in\nwriting in a traditional\nthrough a short presentation, in an infographic, or\nthrough video or audio mediums.\nAs they are working, students may have access\nto multiple materials such as exemplars, sentence\nstems, graphic organizers, highlighters, peer-editing\nand writing conferences with the teacher.\nWhen students have options and choices to access\ntexts and express what they have learned in more\nflexible ways, they can be educated together in an\ninclusive classroom, regardless of variability.\ninformation, listen to the audio version, translate\nthe document into their first language and/\nor collaborate with peers to highlight important\ninformation and\nWhen students have options and choices\nto access texts and express what they\nhave learned in more flexible ways, they\ncan be educated together in an inclusive\nclassroom, regardless of variability.\n23\nconstructed response, or using dictation software,\n,\n24\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nBehavioral Support\nEducators expect to teach academic skills, but when it comes to behavior, often the\nresponse is a simple set of rules that students are expected to follow and a series of\nnegative consequences if they fail to do so. However, in schools implementing MTSS,\neducators understand that behavior, like academics, is learned. As a result, those skills\nmust be explicitly taught, modeled, and positively reinforced and students must be given\nample feedback and opportunities for practice.\nTiered behavioral systems use primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of support to\nprovide a proactive and preventative approach to behavior for all students. The use\nof a multi-tiered model provides students with supports built into daily routines where\nstaff and students review expected behavior, and teach that behavior across the school\nbuilding. In addition, consistent school-wide systems are in place to support frequent\nmethods to provide both positive and corrective feedback to students. It is important\nthat data is incorporated to both identify needs across these tiers, as well as provide\nfeedback on the on-going effectiveness of various individual, classroom, and school-\nlevel efforts. Because it is systematic and comprehensive, tiered behavioral systems\nallow schools to implement screening to identify students who may be at risk, and\nprovide increasingly intensive support for those who need it (Menzies & Lane, 2011).\nBehavioral approaches should support all students, and school teams should work\nwith families and the community to determine how to contextualize support so that it\nis reflective of the values and norms of the community in which the school is located.\nSimilarly, data should be reviewed regularly to examine how behavioral systems and\nsupports differentially impact specific student groups (e.g., disaggregated by race,\nethnicity, gender, disability, etc.).\nEffective classroom management and positive behavior supports are essential for\nsupporting teaching and learning. Schools can maximize success for all students when\nthey: a) develop tiered behavioral systems that are data-driven and responsive to\nstudent needs, b) emphasize that classroom management and positive behavioral\nsupports must be integrated and aligned with effective academic instruction, and c)\nestablish a positive, safe, and supportive school climate that is culturally sustaining.\n25\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nCase in Point: Behavioral Support\nA middle school worked with staff and students\nto develop the core values of P.R.I.D.E. (Patience,\nRespect, Integrity, Determination, and Excellence).\nVisuals are placed on the walls and video monitors\nin hallways, classrooms, the cafeteria, and media\ncenter, reminding\nstudents and families\nabout expected\nbehaviors in all\nschool settings.\nAll the faculty and\nstaff in the school\nsetting have received\ntraining about\nadult expectations\nand receive ongoing in-service training\nspecific to universal screening, progress\nmonitoring, and effective, inclusive\nclassroom management techniques.\nSchool staff have worked with families to\nidentify what P.R.I.D.E. looks like at home\nand the community. They have identified\n25\nengaging positively in the community, sharing\nsuccesses and challenges, making healthy\nchoices, and leading by example as guiding\nprinciples. This is reviewed with all interactions\nbetween school and family members.\nOccasionally\nstudents require\ngreater support,\nand additional\ninterventions have\nbeen identified at\nthe secondary level.\nTwo interventions\nare commonly\nutilized at this\nlevel, including mini social skills lessons and\nCheck-in Check-out (CICO). The latter, CICO, is\na standardized intervention whereby students\nreceive more frequent reminders and review\nof expected behavior, as well as increased\nformalized feedback throughout the day.\nStudents are reminded about\nexpected behaviors in all school\nsettings.\n26\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nSocial Emotional Development\nFor a growing number of schools and districts, social emotional\nlearning (SEL) is recognized as a critical dimension to support\nstudent success. SEL is the process through which students acquire\nand effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary\nto understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals,\nfeel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive\nrelationships, and make responsible decisions.\nWhen students receive social emotional supports that are aligned with academic and behavioral\nefforts, they fare better on many indicators including academic\nachievement metrics, positive social behaviors and attitudes, skills such\nas self-regulation and teamwork, and graduation rates. They also have\nfewer conduct problems, less emotional distress, and lower drug use,\namong many other benefits.\nThe Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL)\ndefines the key SEL competencies as:\n\n Self-awareness\n\n Self-management\n\n Responsible decision making\n\n Relationship skills\n\n Social awareness\nDESE’s Guidance\nDeveloping students’ social emotional competencies can provide an opportunity to develop a\nsense of positive self-worth in connection to a student’s race, color, sex, gender identity, religion,\nnational origin, and sexual orientation. Educators should develop examples and illustrations of these\ncompetencies that are congruent with the social and cultural experiences of their students. SEL\ninstruction that is not culturally responsive can risk becoming a source of\nacculturative stress for students who are not members of the dominant\ngroup.\nSEL needs to be embedded in school and district strategic plans, staffing,\nprofessional learning, and budgets. It must guide curriculum choices and\nclassroom instruction — both direct practice in SEL as well as integrated\ninstruction with reading, math, history, and other subjects and enrichment\nopportunities. It drives schoolwide practices and policies and supports\nhow adults and students relate with each other at all levels of the system, creating a welcoming,\nparticipatory, and caring climate for learning. Integrating SEL into an effective multi-tiered system\nshapes partnerships with families and community members, highlighting engagement, trust, and\ncollaboration.\nSelf-awareness\nResponsible\ndecision making\nRelationship skills\nSelf-management\nSocial awareness\n27\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nCase in Point: Social Emotional Support\nIn a middle school, social & emotional learning\nis integrated into all educational priorities at\nthe classroom and school levels. The school-\nwide SEL focus for the quarter includes building\nself-awareness and relationship management\nskills. Before the quarter started, teachers were\ngiven professional development to support the\nintegration of these competencies into their lesson\nplans. At weekly\ncommon planning\nmeetings, teachers are\nasked to reflect on their\ncapacity to incorporate\nthese strategies and\ngiven support to\nimprove their practice.\nAt the tier 1 level, in\na 7th grade science\nclassroom, students are working on a group lab\nexperiment. To foster self-awareness, before\nbeginning the experiment students are asked to\nreflect individually and engage in small group\ndiscussions about how they might react if the\nexperiment goes well or poorly. Students then\nreflect on those reactions after the experiment.\nStudents are also asked to set group norms around\nhow they will work together and collaborate on\nthe experiment. At the end, students reflect on\ntheir group’s dynamics, how well they followed\ntheir norms, and how they might improve their\ncollaboration in the future.\nIn the cafeteria, students and staff write\n“Conversation Starter” cards to help foster\ncommunication and deeper relationships at lunch.\nThese are replicated\nfor the teacher’s lunch\nroom as well.\nAt their bi-weekly data\nteam meeting, the\neighth grade team\nnoted that five students\nwere struggling to\nform meaningful\nrelationships with peers. The team created a\nplan to check-in individually with each student to\nunpack their perception about the context and\ncontributing factors of the situation. Ultimately the\nteam, with input from these students, established\nan opportunity for them to meet weekly as a small\ngroup to focus on relationship building with the\nguidance counselor.\nSocial & emotional learning is\nintegrated into all school priorities.\n27\n28\nMULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT | BLUEPRINT FOR MA\nREFERENCES\nÐurišic, M., & Bunijevac, M.

She wants to be proactive, not reactive, so she can intervene early and ensure students are on track before the IAR.\n📍 User Story (Her Need):\n\"As a principal, I want a tool that tracks student performance across multiple assessments and school years, so that I can measure the impact of instructional changes and intervene early before the IAR.\"\n📍 What Would Make Her Life Easier?\n✅ A trend analysis dashboard that shows student progress across assessments, not just final scores.\n✅ A way to filter students based on growth trajectories (e.g., “Who started the year strong but is now struggling?”).\n✅ A historical comparison feature that lets her see how student performance has changed year over year.\n✅ The ability to click on a student and instantly see how their attendance, behavior, and grades have influenced their academic progress.\n2️⃣ User Story: AJ (School Improvement Coach) – Making School Data More Actionable and Bridging Gaps\n📍 Who is AJ?\nAJ is a former school improvement coach who worked directly with students before transitioning into a district-wide role helping multiple schools analyze data and improve student outcomes. He understands both the challenges students face and the difficulties schools encounter in making data-driven decisions.\n📍 What’s Most Important to AJ?\n💡 Data is scattered across multiple systems, making it hard to get a complete picture of student performance.\n💡 Principals and school leaders already have a sense of their problems but need clearer recommendations on what to do next.\n💡 A system should not just display numbers—it should guide users through insights and decision-making.\n💡 Schools often face similar challenges but don’t collaborate, missing opportunities to learn from each other.\n📍 His Challenge:\nAJ is frustrated by the disconnect between data, insights, and action. Right now:\nStudent information is fragmented across different platforms—one tracks career certifications, another AP courses, another college enrollment, and another behavior and attendance. There’s no single place to see a full student profile.\nEducators don’t have time to sift through complex spreadsheets—they want clear takeaways and suggested next steps.\nOften, students fall through the cracks simply because it takes too long to identify who needs help.\nCollaboration across schools is weak—leaders are solving the same problems in isolation, when they could be learning from each other’s successes.\n📍 Why This Matters to AJ:\nWhen AJ worked directly with students, he helped them understand their strengths, choose courses, and get into college. Now that he’s working at a systems level, he wants to give school leaders the tools to do the same—but right now, too much time is wasted compiling data instead of acting on it.\n📍 User Story (His Need):\n\"As a school improvement coach, I want a system that consolidates all student performance data in one place and provides clear, actionable insights, so that I can help schools intervene faster and make data-driven decisions without hours of manual analysis.\"\n📍 What Would Make His Life Easier?\n✅ A single dashboard where AP courses, career certifications, attendance, behavior, and assessment scores are all connected in one place.\n✅ Automated student risk identification—if a college-bound student is failing Algebra, the system should flag it immediately instead of requiring AJ to manually search for trends.\n✅ AI-powered recommendations—not just raw data, but clear, actionable next steps based on what has worked for similar schools.\n✅ A \"guided insight discovery\" feature—instead of just displaying graphs, the system should walk users through key takeaways (\"Math scores dropped—this correlates with a rise in absenteeism.\").\n✅ Collaboration tools that connect schools facing the same challenges, so educators can learn from what’s working elsewhere.\n\n3️⃣ User Story: Nicholas (Data Strategist) – Making Complex Education Data Actionable at Scale\n📍 Who is Nicholas?\nNicholas is a data strategist and education consultant who helps district leaders, principals, and policymakers interpret student performance data and turn insights into strategic action.\n📍 What’s Most Important to Nicholas?\n💡 Education leaders have more data than ever, but they don’t always know how to use it effectively.\n💡 Data should be more than numbers—it should provide meaningful insights that lead to better decision-making.\n💡 At a district level, benchmarking and comparative insights are critical for setting goals and identifying best practices.\n💡 A system should help schools understand not just what is happening, but why it’s happening.\n📍 His Challenge:\nNicholas sees that district and school leaders are overwhelmed with raw data but lack actionable insights.\nPrincipals get huge reports filled with numbers, but they don’t always know what they mean or what to do next.\nThere’s no clear way to compare one school’s performance to another, making it difficult to identify best practices.\nThere’s no automation in making connections between factors—for example, if grades are dropping, is it tied to behavior, attendance, or something else?\nLeaders need a way to track progress over time—not just see a snapshot, but understand if the strategies they implement are working.\n📍 Why This Matters to Nicholas:\nNicholas knows that when data is simplified and made actionable, leaders make better decisions. He doesn’t want schools to waste time deciphering reports—he wants them to see clear takeaways instantly and be empowered to act.\n📍 User Story (His Need):\n\"As a district leader, I want a system that translates student data into clear, research-backed insights and benchmarks, so that schools can quickly understand what’s working, what needs attention, and how to improve.\"\n📍 What Would Make His Life Easier?\n✅ A trend analysis dashboard that automatically highlights key performance shifts and provides context for why they are happening.\n✅ Comparative benchmarking tools so he can see how one school’s performance stacks up against others in the district, state, or nationally.\n✅ Automated correlation analysis—if attendance is dropping, the system should suggest, “Attendance is down in certain neighborhoods—consider adjusting transportation or outreach.”\n✅ Longitudinal tracking—a way to measure progress over time and assess whether implemented changes are making an impact.\n✅ Customizable insights—leaders should be able to filter by school, student group, or intervention strategy to see how different factors interact.\n\nCORRELATION MATRIX SUMMARY:\nStudent_ID
